## 15/03/2014 - Pueblo West Amateur Radio Club “Worked All Pueblo West, Co.” award/certificate

A new certificate award is available to any amateur operator who confirms at least ten (10) direct
contacts with amateurs in the 81007 area code, an unincorporated Special District in southern Colorado. 
This award is sponsored by the PWARC, an ARRL-affiliated Ham Club. Pueblo West is one of the most 
rapidly growing communities in both the state of Colorado and the nation. Population statistics show 
a growth from approximately 2,500 in the early 1980’s to over 35, 00 at the present. There are 38 
members in the PWARC out of some 98 licensed operators in this community. Eligibility requirements 
are contacts made on Amateur any band, any mode, but must be direct and not on any repeater. 
Contacts can be verified by QSL cards, LOTW, or copies of official logbook entries. There is no fee for 
paid members of our club, and non-members are asked for a fee of $5.00 to cover verification and 
printing of the certificate.

<div class="bs-callotu bs-callout-info">
On Monday, Feb 10, The Pueblo West Amateur Radio Club (PWARC.com) presented its annual scholarship program to J.T. Turner, Scholarship and Career Coordinator at Pueblo West High School. The club is honored to make this $500 scholarship available to local students as a furtherance of its community service and outreach.
</p><p>

The scholarship is open to any graduating Pueblo West High School student who has maintained at least a 3.0 grade point average and will be majoring in science or electronics in college or other school of higher education. Qualifying students will be asked to prepare a 250-300 word essay listing public service activities, honors, academic awards, plans for college and post- collegiate goals, and how the scholarship would be useful to them.
</p><p>

Applications, essays and letters of recommendations from faculty, counselors, public service, employment, etc. are then sent to the PWARC Secretary where identifying information is removed. The club Board of Directors are then empaneled to select the top three choices. From these three, they will vote to determine the final recipient who will be awarded the scholarship at the Pueblo West High School graduation ceremony.

The Amateur Radio Service—sometimes known as ‘ham’ radio—is a public service and emergency-oriented organization with many diverse forms of communication. From simple radio-to-radio contact, the hobby spans everything from satellite to moon-bounce, from repeaters to reflecting signals off the ionosphere...and much, much more! The sky isn’t even a limit to what can be accomplished in the hobby.  
</p><p>

Everything hams do, whether conversation just for fun, making contacts around the world, or practicing on many various “Nets” is geared toward enhancing their ability to provide reliable communication when the need arises. This includes the ability to operate without power, cell service and/or internet…as well as the ability to conduct all forms of communication not only from home, but also in any type of adverse field or portable conditions. The three recent forest fires are examples of local and regional Amateurs aiding the various emergency service agencies.

</p><p>
Today’s youth are into texting from cell phones. However, there exists scenarios that could bring cell service down. Amateur Operators can continue “texting” or sending messages via radio under such conditions. This popular communication method—known as “packeting”—comes in many formats, is conducted at high-speed, and can be independent of cell, internet service or electrical power. Many young Amateur Radio enthusiasts find this area of the hobby very appealing.

</p><p>
As one of its priorities, the Pueblo West Amateur Radio Club is dedicated to helping educate any individual with a desire to learn about the tremendous variety within the Amateur Radio Service.  The Scholarship Program is just one of many programs and events that PWARC conducts.
</p><p>
Calling itself “A Friendly Radio Club” PWARC meets every 3rd Saturday at 2pm at the Pueblo West Library, King Rm A or B, and visitors are ALWAYS WELCOME.
