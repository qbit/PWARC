Examinations

HAMS ARE *NOT* CITIZEN BAND RADIO OPERATORS

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requires every Amateur Radio operator to pass at least one of its three tests to receive a license. The more licenses you pass, the more privileges you receive on the radio. Becoming a ham is not difficult, however it does require you to do some work to pass the examinations. If you are not willing to put in some time studying for the required examination(s), you may want to take up a different hobby.

LICENSES
--------

There are currently three license classes: Technician, General and Amateur Extra. The higher grade the license you hold, the more privileges you will enjoy.

Some hams never progress beyond the entry level Technician license, and they are happy to just have the privileges that license conveys. With this license they are limited to fewer bands, and a majority of Technician license holders can be found working on VHF and UHF frequencies.

The General Class license is for those who want to learn more about electronics and gain more High Frequency privileges. This enables them the opportunity to talk farther and to use more bands to communicate.

The Amateur Extra license is the highest license class available. A more thorough understanding of electronics is required for this exam, but it also conveys all the privileges available to the hobbyists.

Preparing for your examination
------------------------------

In years past, those who aspired to attain a ham radio license had to learn the Morse code at prescribed speeds for each license class. This requirement was eliminated a few years ago. Now, you need only pass a multiple choice test to become licensed. The current Question Pools for each of the exams are also available on line at [ARRl Question Pool](http://www.arrl.org/question-pools).

If you want to purchase a basic license study guide for any of the three classes of licenses, there are two we would recommend. One is published by ARRL, and the other is authored by Gorden West. These can easily be found by a search of the Internet. Wherever you get it, just be sure to get then newest edition, as the question pools change from time to time.

Recently, our club has been recommending the free downloadable No-Nonsense license study guides by KB6NU. Our members have commented they have found them to be very useful and easier to use than the books listed above.

Our club periodically offers free classes to help those who are interested in joining our hobby. We have found, however, that those who study at least an additional hour a day at home have the best chance of passing their exam on the first try. Learning what you can on your own, and then bringing your questions to the classes, is the most effective way of learning.

The passing grade on ham radio exams is 74%. We have found that on-line practice tests can be a valuable part of the learning process when studying for exams. As you progress toward your goal and are studying the license manual, supplement your study by taking at least two on-line exams a day. When you are consistently receiving scores of 90% and above, you should be ready for your exam. On-line practice tests are available at:

VE Sessions
-----------

Pueblo West Amateur Radio Club, in conjunction with Pueblo Ham Club, schedules periodic VE Sessions at Pueblo West Library, 298 S. Joe Martinez Blvd., Pueblo West, for those wishing to take Amateur Radio examinations. We believe in doing things correctly. To ensure you receive a reputable test, Volunteer Examiners (VEs) from Pueblo West Amateur Radio Club, Pueblo Ham Club, and a VE not associated with either club will be present to supervise the testing.

When you arrive to take your exam, you will need to have the following with you:

1. A legal photo ID (driver license or passport). When no photo ID is available, two forms of identification must be presented:
    * non-photo ID/driver's license
    * birth certificate (must have the appropriate seal)
    * social security card
    * library card
    * utility bill, bank statement or other business correspondence that specifically names the person; or a postmarked envelope addressed to the person at his or her current mailing address as it appears on the FCC Form 605.
    * **Students may bring any of the above items and/or a school ID, minor's work permit, report card, or a legal guardian may present a photo ID.**
2. Social Security Number (SSN) or your FCC issued Federal Registration Number (FRN). VECâ€™s are required by FCC to submit either your SSN or your FRN number with your license application form. If you prefer not to give your SSN, then you may use your FCC issued FRN, if you have one. For instructions on how to register your SSN with the FCC and receive a FRN, visit the FCC's FAQ page and the FCC's registration instructions page.

3. If applicable, bring the original and a photocopy of your current Amateur Radio license (The wallet card will work fine.) and any Certificates of Successful Completion of Examination (CSCE) you may hold from previous exam sessions. The photocopy(s) will not be returned.

4. Two #2 pencils with erasers and a ball point pen.

5. A calculator with the memory erased and formulas cleared is allowed. You may not bring any written notes or calculations into the exam session. Slide rules and logarithmic tables are acceptable, as long as they're free of notes and formulas. Cell phone must be silenced or turned off during the exam session and the phones' calculator function may not be used. In addition, iPhones, iPads, Androids, smartphones, Blackberry devices and all similar electronic devices with a calculator capability, may NOT be used.

6. A fee of $15 (preferably by check made out to ARRL/VEC) for the test.
    1. If you do not pass the exam, you may take a second one, but there is an additional $15 fee.
    2. If you do pass the exam and want to attempt the next higher grade test, you can take that test for no additional fee. For example, if you pass the Technician Class, you can also take the General Class exam that day for no extra charge. We suggest that you take the higher class test. Even if you do not pass it, it will give you an idea of the type of questions that will be asked the next time you take it.

There are 35 questions on the Technician exam and the General exams, and 50 questions on the Amateur Extra exams. You can miss 9 questions and still pass the Technician and General examinations, and you can miss 13 and pass Amateur Extra Class exams.

After turning in your test for grading, DO NOT LEAVE. Your test will be graded within a few minutes, and you will be told whether you have passed the exam. If so, you will need to sign another form which will be sent to the FCC. You will also have the opportunity to take the next higher license exam at no charge.
