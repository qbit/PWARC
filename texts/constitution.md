Pueblo West Amateur Radio Club Constitution 

Revised November 24, 2010

 

Statement of Purpose: 

1. Our organization is organized exclusively for charitable, educational and scientific 

purposes, including, for such purposes, the making of distributions to organizations that 

qualify as exempt organizations under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, or 

corresponding section of any future federal tax code. 

Statement of Goals: 

The Pueblo West Amateur Radio Club has the following goals: 

1. To promote and further the amateur radio hobby and an interest in science, especially 

through today’s youth; 

2. To provide financial assistance through annual scholarships to Pueblo West High 

School graduates who will be majoring in science in college, and particularly those 

going into the teaching profession; 

3. To Increase our personal knowledge of electronics, radio, and communications in order to 

provide skilled civilian communications operators with the ability to support our 

community with emergency and disaster communications when called upon to do so; 

4. To bring those with an interest in electronics into our hobby through classes and our 

Volunteer Examiner Sessions where amateur radio license examinations are given; and 

5. To offer benefits, support and a sense of community to all individuals who share a 

common interest in Amateur Radio and electronics. 

Article I: Membership 

All individuals expressing an interest in Amateur Radio communications are eligible for 

membership in the Pueblo West Amateur Radio Club. One does not need an amateur radio 

license to be an active participant of the club. However, only licensed members may hold office 

in the organization, and vote in elections for the selection of the organization's officers. It is 

believed that those with a license and the knowledge that comes with it are better prepared to 

contribute to the club’s mission. 

Recognizing we all have our weaknesses and that not everyone can do every task that needs to 

be done, each member will be expected to participate in club projects and activities to the best 

of his/her experience and abilities. Active, enthusiastic members are the building blocks of any 

organization, and each has knowledge and skills to contribute. In order for the Pueblo West 

Amateur Radio Club to succeed and for each person to enjoy the experiences the membership 

can bring, there will be many varied ways for members to contribute to the club’s success. 

Membership identification cards for the club shall be issued to members who pay their dues. 

Membership dues shall be determined by the executive committee and must be paid yearly by 

all members. Exceptions to this rule must be confirmed by a two-thirds membership vote. 

Honorary memberships may be issued without a fee to non-licensed individuals who support 

our club’s goals. These may include such persons as emergency responders, law enforcement 

personnel, and club donors.
