PWARC Scholarship Information for Club
======================================

Our second scholarship will be awarded in April 2014

An annual scholarship will be made available to a graduating Pueblo West High School student who has maintained at least a 3.0 grade point average and will be majoring in science or electronics in college or other school of higher education.  Club members and their relatives are not eligible for the scholarship.  The student must be a legal resident and citizen of the United States of America.

Scholarship amounts may vary on available funds and the amount will be set annually by vote of the club members.  For 2014 the award has been set at $500.00.
Scholarships will be publicized through the high school Guidance Counselor’s office.
Students shall prepare a 250-300 word essay listing public service activities, honors, academic awards, plans for college and post-collegiate goals, and how the scholarship would be useful to them.  Applications, essays and letters of recommendations from faculty, counselors, public service, employment, etc. are to be sent to the club Secretary listed on the application.

The Secretary will number them and distribute to the club’s Board of Directors (with no identifiable information) for judging and selecting the top three choices and from those, they will vote to determine the winner.

In the event the Board feels no suitable applications have been submitted, the club may retain the scholarship.
The Secretary will contact the Pueblo West High School Scholarship Office with the results.  A representative of PWARC will present a scholarship certificate at the annual Pueblo West High School graduation ceremony. 

Scholarship funds will be sent directly to the school of the student’s choice to be applied to the student’s first quarter enrollment fees.  If the student does not enroll for the first quarter of the current year, the scholarship will be awarded to the runner-up and sent to the school of his/her choice to be applied toward enrollment fees.
