       <FONT SIZE="4">Radio direction finding (also T-Hunting, Fox Hunting, 
       or Bunny Hunting) is used to find sources of interference to any form 
       of wireless electronic communications, including broadcast and 
       two-way radio, television and telephones.<IMG SRC="Fox.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="181" VSPACE="10" HSPACE="10" BORDER="0" LOOP="0"> 
       Search and Rescue workers use it to find persons in distress, and 
       Emergency Locator Transmitters in downed aircraft are tracked with 
       RDF techniques. Hams use RDF to track jamming stations and stolen 
       equipment, but more often, they use it just for fun. Hidden 
       transmitter hunting has been done by hams for about 50 years and it 
       is a growing activity.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Using 'hide-and-seek&quot; procedures, a growing 
       number of ham radio operators have taken up the task of finding 
       hidden transmitters (know as the &quot;Fox&quot;). Since this 
       involves only the reception of signals by the trackers (the Hounds), 
       Fox Hunting does not require a ham radio license to participate. 
       Therefore, it is becoming a popular family activity as well.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Sometimes the event will be held on foot, while other 
       times the beginning distance between the Fox and the Hounds 
       necessitate the use of a vehicle. Sometimes the &quot;Fox&quot; may 
       be disguised to make the hunt more difficult, so watch out for 
       &quot;Wolves&quot; when you are hunting too. Whatever the case, it is 
       a fun activity! If you do not have the necessary equipment but would 
       like to know more about this fun &quot;radiosport&quot;, we will team 
       you up with equipped members for the hunt.</FONT></TD>
