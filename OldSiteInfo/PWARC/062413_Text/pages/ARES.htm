   <FONT SIZE="4">Amateur radio is not just a hobby, it is a service. 
   The licenses we hold are a privilege granted to us by the FCC. These 
   licenses carry some responsibilities, including the responsibility we 
   have for providing emergency communications in the event of a 
   disaster. All of the training we do, from participating in a formal 
   traffic net to setting up a Field Day or special event station, makes 
   us better communicators. Field events, local Ragchews, and monthly 
   meetings improve the camaraderie we enjoy as Hams.</FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE="4">Our expertise in communications, whatever the type of 
   communication is needed, is our contribution to public service. In 
   times of national or local emergencies, the communications effort and 
   expertise of Amateur Radio has been challenged, and our efforts and 
   expertise have allowed Amateur Radio to meet the challenge.</FONT></P>

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE="4"><FONT COLOR="BLUE">In a significant emergency, local 
   professional first responders establish an Incident Command Post at 
   or near the scene of the emergency to manage the response. All of our 
   local government agencies use the Incident Command System (ICS). The 
   on-line FEMA ICS-100 and ICS-200 training courses describe the basics 
   of ICS. Both courses are required training for ARES responders.</FONT></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE="4"><FONT COLOR="BLUE">An ARES Emergency Coordinator may 
   request deployment of ARES members to the Incident Command Post or to 
   another site of the emergency to support the disaster response. This 
   is done at the request of the Incident Commander or based on prior 
   agreements. ARES members are <U>NOT</U> first responders and are 
   strongly discouraged from self-deploying to an incident, as an influx 
   of unneeded volunteers complicates the disaster response and hinders 
   the professional responders who could otherwise be protecting life 
   and property.</FONT></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE="4"><FONT COLOR="RED">After learning of an emergency, 
   monitor the ARES resource net repeater on 146.790 MHz. Emergency 
   Coordinators will use the frequency to provide updates and direct an 
   ARES response.</FONT></FONT></P>

    The Incident Commander or his disignated representative may log

    other staff. ARES communicators are assigned to the Logistics 
    Section, under the Communications Unit Leader in the ICS structure.</FONT></FONT></P>

    <FONT SIZE="4"><FONT COLOR="RED">Current emergency management 
    doctrine places ARES communicators in the role of the backup to the 
    backup to the primary communications means. In almost every 
    deployment, the professional responders are accommodating ARES 
    involvement because their primary communications means are adequate. 
    But many realize that we have been badly needed in the past and that 
    we will be needed again in the future. We need the knowledge, skills, 
    and mindset to perform our volunteer functions on their terms. So 
    that when they do need us, we will be there.</FONT></FONT></P>
