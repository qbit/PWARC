       <FONT SIZE="4">Sooner or later, questions arise about Anderson 
       PowerPole connectors: What are they? How do you use them? Where can I 
       get them? How do I install them? Do I have to have one of those 
       expensive crimping tools? What if I ruin a metal contact?</FONT></P>

        <FONT SIZE="4">Anderson PowerPoles have become the standard 12-volt 
        DC connector for many ARES teams. They make changing equipment such 
        as transceivers and power supplies simple. There is no winding wires 
        around power terminals, or having the wrong size ring or fork 
        terminal to fit the power supply terminals. Unplug one radio, plug 
        another in. The job is done. If the plastic housings are configured 
        correctly (see below), there is no danger of &quot;letting the fire 
        out of a rig&quot; by connecting it to the wrong polarity of the 
        power supply terminals. The PowerPoles simply won't fit together if 
        they are not matched correctly.</FONT></P>

       <LI>
       <P>
        <FONT SIZE="4">The most common use is for power transfer from 
        batteries or DC power supplies to radios. However, let your 
        imagination run free. Just remember than the connectors are NOT 
        weatherproof, so be careful when using them outside. If they must be 
        used outside in damp weather, for example, make sure they are wrapped 
        tightly with plastic, etc. I use then to hook ground mounted solar 
        panels together and run #10 wires to the charge controller in our 
        travel trailer. From the charge controller, the current is run to the 
        batteries through another pair of #10 wires and a pair of Anderson 
        Power Poles at the batteries.</FONT></P>

        hobby. The 30 Amp size along with 12 gauge red/black zip-cord seems 
        to be the best overall choice for most applications and numerous 
        other groups have adopted it.</FONT></P>

        <FONT SIZE="4">All contacts have a round hole into which the wire is 
        inserted EXCEPT for the 45-amp contacts used for up to #10 wire. It 
        is a &quot;U&quot; that must be rounded over the wire. Yeah, I know, 
        that's DUMB... but that's how they are made. Eventually you will get 
        used to this arrangement and will be able to make the crimp over #10 
        wire without too much difficulty.</FONT></P>

        <FONT SIZE="4">I prefer to use red and black &quot;zip cord&quot; for 
        all of my 12-volt DC power connections. The price varies widely from 
        dealer to dealer, so check around on the Internet for the best price 
        you can find. For runs of more than 15 feet, use the largest wire 
        size you can, and make sure it has a safe current handing capability 
        of MORE than you need.</FONT></P>
       <LI>
       <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
        <FONT SIZE="4">For #8 wire, use 75-amp PowerPole connectors. These 
        are much larger than the standard 30/45-amp connectors, and much more 
        costly as well. However, if voltage drop is an issue, you may want to 
        consider using larger wires and PowerPoles to bring power to where 
        you need it, then make a jumper which goes from the 75-amp PowerPole 
        connector to a 30/45- amp PowerPole at your rig.</FONT></P>
       <LI>
       <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
        <FONT SIZE="4">A 15-, 30-, or 45-amp Powerpole connector pin will 
        actually withstand well over 100 amps without damage and close to 200 
        amps before actually causing permanent damage. The voltage drop of a 
        Powerpole 30-amp connector is approximately .016 volts at 37 amps.</FONT></P>

        <FONT SIZE="4">Powerpoles should be installed at the power cord where 
        the cord fastens to the power source. The fuses in both legs of the 
        power cord should be retained.</FONT></P>

         <FONT SIZE="4">Cut the wires the same length. Remove enough of the

         <FONT SIZE="4">The round hole where the wire goes into the contact 
         has a seam. Put this seam towards the ROUNDED side of the crimper's 
         dye and crimp the contact.</FONT></P>

         <FONT SIZE="4">Once you have made the crimp, there are two problems

         <P>
          <FONT SIZE="4">The most common problem is that the contact is too 
          wide in the area where it has clamped onto the wire. The available 
          gap is measured in thousandths of an inch! Alternately round and 
          crimp the contact using the front and back dies of the crimper until 
          it is a uniform width along the entire contact, yet firmly holds the wire.</FONT></P>
         <LI>
         <P>
          <FONT SIZE="4">The tongue of the contact MUST be completely straight 
          to go into the housing. They sometimes get bent downward by the 
          crimper. Just lay it on something flat and gently bend it back into position.</FONT></P>

        <FONT SIZE="4">Not usually, but it will depend on the size of wiring

        can be used on #10 and smaller wire, and these are usually available 
        wherever PowerPoles are sold. They should cost around $10.00-$15.00.

        connectors, however, you will need a heavy-duty racheting crimper 
        designed for the job. Again, look around. Some companies want $39.95 
        for this tool that is advertised to crimp the 75-amp connectors (It

        special for much less.</FONT></P>
