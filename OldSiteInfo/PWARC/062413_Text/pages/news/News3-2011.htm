        a chance to take the exam before the new questions appear on the

         sequences and Morse code messages at user-programmed times, so it can 
         be programmed to send tones and the required 10-minute ID. With this 
         unit a transmitter can hidden and left to be found, making it more 
         difficult to find the transmitter.</FONT></P>
        <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

        next three weeks on the Canon City repeater (145.490 - PL103.5). 
        After four weeks a determination will be made as to whether to 
        continue using their repeater. After the net, members are asked to 
        meet on 146.445 MHz FM simplex. Any stations that can not check into 
        the Canon City repeater will be picked up on simplex, and Amateur 
        Radio Newsline will be played. Short training sessions will soon be 
        given as well.</FONT></P>
