        <LI><FONT SIZE="4">Jim, NE0DA, reported his first PSK31 was with

        as well.</FONT><BR>
        <LI><FONT SIZE="4">Andy, AB8HQ, applied for membership in Colorado 
        ARES. Six of the club's members now belong to the Amateur Radio 
        Emergency Service (ARES).</FONT></P>

      <P>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Since the treasurer, Dan, NG0T, was not in attendance, 
       discussion on whether the club needs a Board of Directors (even if 
       one person), and what legal language should be placed in the 
       Constitution to formally ratify the club's incorporation, was tabled 
       for a future meeting. Auditing the treasury on an annual basis was 
       also discussed, and the consensus of those present was that it was a 
       good idea. This will be on the agenda again at a later date.</FONT></P>
      <P>
       <FONT SIZE="4">NE0DA reported that the club now has a bank account. 
       Only the President, Vice-President and the Treasurer can sign checks, 
       and two signatures are required. All three officers have now signed 
       the bank's signature card. The club had $456 in its treasury at the 
       time of the deposit. The club's incorporation cost $50, and there was 
       a $15 charge for checks from Frontier Bank. He reported that $25 was 
       retained as petty cash as well. That should leave a balance of $366 
       in the bank account and $25 in petty cash for a total of $391.00 in 
       the treasury.</FONT></P>
      <P>
       <FONT SIZE="4">A discussion was held concerning changing the amount 
       of members needed to constitute a quorum for minor changes to the 
       Constitution that are needed to satisfy incorporation rules. A quorum 
       for this is currently 2/3 of the licensed members, however it is very 
       difficult to get a quorum of members to attend a meeting. It was 
       suggested that perhaps the number of members be lowered for a few 
       upcoming changes in language showing the club is now incorporated. A 
       poll of the members by telephone is an option that can still be used 
       for this. No decision was made, and the item was tabled and will be 
       brought up at a later meeting when the treasurer is present. A 
       statement of dissolution required for incorporation was added to the 
       Constitution last month after a quorum of 2/3 of the membership was 
       contacted (mostly by telephone) and approved the addition. Those 
       voting for the amendment were:</FONT></P>

       <FONT SIZE="4">It was decided that the Sunday morning HF net will be 
       discontinued. It will continue to be held on Sunday evenings at 7:30 
       p.m. on 28.305 MHz following the club's VHF net.</FONT></P>
      <P>
       <FONT SIZE="4">PWARC will offer classes for the Technician Class 
       license on Thursdays beginning January 28. The classes will be held 
       from 7-9:00 p.m. at Fire Station #3, 729 E. Gold Dr. (E. Platteville 
       Blvd/ E. McCulloch Blvd) in north Pueblo West. This is a very nice 
       facility with everything needed for teaching. The classes are free 
       and will be taught by Paul, KB0JIT, and Ed, KD5MHI.</FONT></P>
      <P>
       <FONT SIZE="4">WA0KAQ volunteered and was approved as Trustee for the 
       club's amateur radio license. Following this, President Jim McConnell 
       signed the application for a club call sign. It is hoped the call 
       sign will be issued before the club's next meeting. It will be a 
       sequential call, assigned by the FCC at no charge. If the club 
       wishes, it can trade that call for a Vanity call sign which currently 
       costs $13.40 and is good for 10 years. Since the Trustee is the 
       holder of an Extra Class license, the call sign will be issued as an 
       Extra Class license as well. Should the Trustee change in the future, 
       the license class will change according to the license class of the 
       Trustee, however the call sign will remain the same.</FONT></P>
      <P>
       <FONT SIZE="4">The members approved WA0KAQ's request to continue as 
       the club's webmaster. Bill has been working on a mirror website which 
       can quickly be installed on its own site after the final ham license 
       is received.</FONT></P>
      <P>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Members agreed that an informal gathering for coffee 
       or breakfast and ragchew should be held once a month, approximately 
       half way between meetings. The first Ham Radio Ragchew will be held 
       at 9:00 a.m. Saturday, Feb. 6, at the Hen House Restaurant, 53 Palmer 
       Lake Dr. (cross street, S. Joe Martinez Blvd.). All ham radio 
       operators are invited to attend.</FONT></P>
      <P>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Logistics/Operations Officer, Bill, KB0RPD, announced 
       he has contacted the National Weather Service office in reference to 
       obtaining 12 volt batteries that they are obligated to change on a 
       regular schedule. If the batteries are obtained, they will be 
       distributed to club members who want them. The batteries should make 
       good back up power sources for our radios.</FONT></P>
      <P>
       <FONT SIZE="4">President McConnell appointed Jane, KE6DCE, as head of 
       the club's Ways and Means Committee. Jane will head the club's 
       fundraising activities.</FONT></P>
      <P>
       <FONT SIZE="4">A Volunteer Examiner (VE) session will be held by 
       Pueblo Ham Club from 1-3:00 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 13, at Rawlings 
       Library, 100 E. Abriendo Ave., in Pueblo. Tests for all classes of 
       amateur radio licenses will be available. The cost is $15 (cash, no 
       checks) per test. Further information is on the club's website.</FONT></P>
      <P>
       <FONT SIZE="4">The club continues to look for a Field Day site in 
       Pueblo West, though the community seems to have little to offer. As 
       Field Day is used as a recruiting tool and a way to let residents 
       know about our club, the club is seeking a location that will provide 
       public exposure as well as provide ample space for antennas and other 
       outdoor stations accessories.</FONT></P>
      <P>
       <FONT SIZE="4">KB0RPD reported that Parks and Recreation was not 
       receptive to our use of Lovell Park for Field Day after 10:30 p.m., 
       and the charge would have been $75 per day. That location, which was 
       formerly our first choice, has therefore been rejected.</FONT></P>
      <P>
       <FONT SIZE="4">KB0RPD and NE0DA will meet with a representative of 
       Parks and Recreation on Monday to discuss what could be used in the 
       area of the tennis courts behind the Sheriff's Station. The area has 
       been walked, and we are certain we do not want to use the bare dirt 
       areas or the lightly graveled areas surrounding the tennis courts for 
       parking the motor home or trailer. This area is very soft even when 
       dry, and if there is rain before or during the event, much of this 
       would be a quagmire.</FONT></P>
      <P>
       <FONT SIZE="4">The paved cul-de-sac is an option that has been 
       discussed, as well as the tennis court parking lot. It is doubtful 
       the tennis court parking lot can be obtained however. Parks and 
       Recreation has said they would let the club use this area for much 
       less than they wanted for Lovell Park, and there are porta-potties at 
       the location in the summer months.</FONT></P>
      <P>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Anyone with ideas of a better location in Pueblo West 
       that meets the stated requirements is asked to call Bill, KA0RPD, 547-0694,
        or Jim, NE0DA, 647-9601.</FONT></P>
      <P>
       <FONT SIZE="4">WA0KAQ gave a program on analog and digital Slow Scan 
       Television (SSTV) using MMSSTV software for analog SSTV and EasyPal 
       software for digital SSTV. Both programs are free and can be 
       downloaded from the Internet. An attempt to connect to an Automatic 
       Packet Reporting System (APRS) through the library's DSL network 
       failed. Bill will try to discover the reason and provide that program 
       at a later date.</FONT></P>
      <P>
       <FONT SIZE="4">The meeting was adjourned at 3:55 p.m.</FONT></TD>
