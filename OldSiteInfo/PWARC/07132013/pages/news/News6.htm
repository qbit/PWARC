        opening was to Oregon, where he worked four stations. During this 
        opening, he added 15 more states and a Canadian mobile. He also 
        worked Samoa for the first time, using CW. He reported that his 
        FT-897D which was to be used at Field Day was having problems, and 
        that there was not enough time to have it repaired before the event. 
        He purchased a new FT-897D. The original rig will be repaired and sold.</FONT></P>

       <FONT SIZE="4">1) Change in Constitution</FONT></P>
      <UL>
       <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
        <FONT SIZE="4">WA0KAQ requested a revision to change the number of 
        votes needed for changes to the Constitution. The club visited this 
        issue before, but no action was taken. WA0KAQ stated it is getting 
        more difficult to contact a quorum of members It was noted that the 
        club probably only had a quorum of its members at a meeting twice in 
        the history of the club, and this has caused a lot of extra work on 
        the Secretary's part to call and e-mail members each time a change is 
        necessary. The Constitution allows for polling members either by 
        phone or e-mail when issues may be decided.</FONT></P>
       <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
        <FONT SIZE="4">More changes will need to be made to the club's 
        Constitution this summer and fall, primarily dealing with detailing 
        with establishing terms of office, duties, etc, for the Board of 
        Directors; and 2) changing the club's corporate status to a non-profit
         corporate status.</FONT></P>
       <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
        <FONT SIZE="4">&nbsp;It was proposed that the required vote of 
        &quot;2/3 of the licensed members&quot; be changed to a vote of 
        &quot;2/3 of the licensed members present at the meeting where 
        changes are discussed.&quot; The monthly agenda always references 
        proposed Constitutional changes, allowing members to come to the 
        meeting and voice their opinions.</FONT></P>
       <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
        <FONT SIZE="4">A motion was made by Paul, KB0JIT, to change the 
        wording as described above, and this was seconded by Jane, KA0USA. 
        The vote was 10-0 in favor of the change. Under the current wording, 
        however, at least 5 more affirmative votes are needed, and the 
        Secretary will make e-mail contacts, and telephone contacts as 
        necessary to poll the members who were absent.</FONT></P>

       <FONT SIZE="4">2) Board of Directors</FONT></P>
      <UL>
       <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
        <FONT SIZE="4">At the May meeting, the secretary was requested to 
        write new language for the Constitution pertaining to the 
        newly-elected Board of Directors. However, since the club has 
        established no guidelines as to the Board's duties, length of the 
        Directors' terms, when elections will take place, etc., the 
        Constitution can not be amended at this time. WA0KAQ suggested that 
        the treasurer, NG0T, be enlisted to help write the necessary 
        language. Since the treasurer was absent, further discussion was 
        tabled until the next regular meeting.</FONT></P>

       <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
        <FONT SIZE="4">KB0RPD reported that some batteries received from a 
        different source were no good and would be recycled.</FONT></P>
       <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
        <FONT SIZE="4">As we get batteries to give out, those hams who are 
        active on the air will get them first. The hams who are active and 
        present at the meetings and don't have batteries yet can put their 
        names in a hat, and names will be drawn for the available batteries.</FONT></P>
       <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
        <FONT SIZE="4">Those who receive batteries will need to buy a small 
        (1-amp) charger if they don't have one. It should be the type that 
        changes to a trickle charge once the battery is charged. Chargers 
        without this feature can damage the batteries if left on too long. 
        W0NHF has a good one (1.5 amps maximum) he bought at Walmart for 
        about $20, and will be glad to tell you about it.</FONT></P>

       <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
        <FONT SIZE="4">One of the benefits allows us to do is to keep $15 of

        planning to join the ARRL and get QST Magazine, please file through 
        the club. ARRL membership application forms from the secretary. The

        Applicants pay the club $15, and ARRL will accept the rest ($24) by 
        credit card if you so desire. If not, the club will accept your check

         <FONT SIZE="4">On April 22 and May 19, WA0KAQ participated in ARRL 
         Public Relations Webinars about how to promote Field Day. They were 
         conducted by the ARRL's Atlantic Division. One of the things stressed 
         was that outside of an actual disaster, Field Day is by far the one 
         day each year that the public gets to see Amateur Radio in action. 
         The presenters also stressed, &quot;You don't get a second chance to 
         make a good first impression.&quot; People perceive us as they see 
         us, so it is important that everyone be well-groomed and well dressed 
         for the event. So comb your hair and brush your teeth, and you might 
         want to bring an extra set of clothes along that you can change into 
         after the antennas, shades, and other things are put up on Saturday.</FONT></P>
        <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
         <FONT SIZE="4">If someone asks you what Amateur Radio is and what we 
         are doing, each person needs an answer. The presenters suggested that 
         everyone rehearse a 30-second summary of what Amateur Radio is. I 
         don't believe that is necessary, however everyone should think about 
         what he would say if asked. Basically we want to get the point across that:</FONT></P>
