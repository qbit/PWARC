         County held a meeting at the Search and Rescue building in 
         Westcliffe, on March 15. The purposed of the meeting was to attempt 
         to get Amateur Radio/ARES operators to coordinate between the 11 
         counties in his region to form an emergency communications group. 
         Riley Frazee, a Colorado Regional Emergency Coordinator for the State 
         from Baca County, was also present. Neal (KD0MBL), Steve (KD0QCF), 
         Jeff (KC0CTN), and Bill (KD0RPD) represented our club.</FONT></P>

         <FONT SIZE="4">Bill, KB0RPD, reported that the main conversation of 
         the meeting centered around connecting all the counties with linked 
         repeaters. Riley Frazee told the group that commercial radio 
         standards are changing, and new standards for the commercial stations 
         now dictate the use of narrow band FM equipment by September 2013. 
         Therefore, commercial radio dealers are beginning to replace good 
         working repeaters with narrow band repeaters. As a result, there will 
         be an abundance of repeaters available at very low prices that could 
         be used for amateur use.</FONT></P>

        <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
         <FONT SIZE="4">Correspondence to the club from Dwight, WB0HBJ, noted 
         there would be expenses involved to change the repeaters for amateur 
         use, as well as maintenance after installation. The repeaters are 
         also somewhat large in size. They are 19-inch rack-mount models the
