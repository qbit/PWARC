         <FONT SIZE="4">In addition to the Basic Emergency Plan that was set 
         up for club members, there is also an advanced plan for those who 
         want to be involved. This plan provides for the possibility of 
         providing back-up communications for public service agencies or other 
         groups in case they are needed. The plan is quite lengthy, and it 
         involves occasional training exercises. It also involves setting up 
         more digital communications which may include training in FLdigi and 
         its plug-in programs, APRS, PSK-31, Packet, RMS Express, SSTV, and 
         traffic handling and more.</FONT></P>

         <FONT SIZE="4">Ed (NI5R) is in charge of the plan and training 
         exercises. The first training session will be held in January. Those 
         whoare interested in participating in the emergency preparedness team 
         that can benefit the community were asked to contact Ed to be signed 
         up. Ed will set up the first training session at the new LDS Church.</FONT></P>
