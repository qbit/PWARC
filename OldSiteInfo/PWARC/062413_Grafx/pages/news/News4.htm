       <FONT SIZE="4">Items Still Tabled:</FONT></P>
      <UL>
       <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
        <FONT SIZE="4">1) Club's need for a Board of Directors? - Dan, NG0T, 
        who did our incorporation paperwork, explained we are not a 501(3)c 
        corporation, but he will research this issue further. The item was 
        tabled at February meeting.</FONT></P>
       </UL>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">The club is awaiting word from ARRL as to whether its 
       application for ARRL Club Affiliation has been accepted. WA0KAQ sent 
       documents requesting the affiliation to the ARRL Executive Committee 
       on April 6. To become affiliated and retain affiliation, 51% of the 
       voting members must be ARRL members. KA0USA is our club's newest ARRL 
       member, bringing our percentage to 64% as of April 6. The affiliation 
       must be approved by the Colorado Section Communications Manager, the 
       Rocky Mountain Division Director, and the ARRL Executive Committee in 
       order for the club to be given affiliation. After we receive the 
       affiliation, if anyone wants to join or renew a membership, please do 
       it through the club, as we can retain a portion of most fees for the 
       club's treasury.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">In recognition of National Library Month, Pueblo West 
       Amateur Radio Club presented a 1-year subscription to CQ Magazine to 
       Pueblo West Library during the club's April 17 meeting. Club 
       president Jim McConnell (NE0DA) made the presentation of the April 
       issue of the magazine to librarian Cindy Shimizu, along with a 
       Certificate of Recognition. (See Photos page on website)</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">President McConnell expressed the club's appreciation 
       for the support it has received from Pueblo West Library, as well as 
       the excellent facilities it provides. Ms. Shimizo thanked the club 
       for the donation and stated the monthly issues will be placed in 
       clear plastic covers and will be labeled as being provided by Pueblo 
       West Amateur Radio Club.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">The Pueblo West Committee On Architecture approved the 
       club's application for Field Day signs at its April 8 meeting. We now 
       have the paperwork from them.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">The club's FD Handbook has been sent to members by 
       e-mail. Some appendixes have also been sent, while others await 
       information from the membership. If you have not done so, please 
       print the Annex N you received (Field Day Questionnaire), fill it 
       out, and send it by mail or e-mail to WA0KAQ. Only two questionnaires 
       have been received (ND0P &amp; WG6WSI).</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">With only 69 days until Field Day, invitations are 
       starting to be distributed. KB0RPD was given the invitation for the 
       American Red Cross at today's meeting. Other invitations will soon be 
       ready for distribution.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">NE0DA and WA0KAQ met with Larry Howe-Kerr, Manager of 
       the Pueblo West Metropolitan District on April 9. They presented 
       Howe-Kerr and his staff a formal invitation to Field Day. They 
       requested a proclamation proclaiming the last week of June as Amateur 
       Radio Week in Pueblo West. Howe-Kerr will present the request to the 
       Pueblo West Metropolitan Board for their approval. If the Board 
       approves, the proclamation will be presented in early June so the 
       announcement can be made in the newspaper the week of Field Day.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Bill (KB0RPD) will be checking on the used USB 
       batteries we requested from the NWS. The batteries will be needed in 
       May so the club can begin experimenting with them for the Field Day exercise.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Field Day always seems to be a weekend of high 
       temperatures. One of the things we will use to try to entice visitors 
       to Field Day is to offer FREE refreshments, which will consist of 
       cookies and iced tea or ice water. Andy (KD0P) has volunteered the 
       use of a 5-gallon dispenser, and Jim (NE0DA) volunteered an ice chest 
       and ice. More ice cubes will be needed, so if you can help out with 
       this, please contact Jane (KA0USA).</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Andy (ND0P) reported that work on the two Field Day 
       signs is progressing. They will each say &quot;Visitors Welcome!&quot;
        above &quot;Free Refreshments!&quot; The top section of each that 
       says &quot;Visitors Welcome!&quot; can be taken off so they can be 
       used separately at other events.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">WA0KAQ announced that the club's Field Day site has 
       been set on the ARRL's new Field Day Locator web page. In fact, it is 
       listed twice. The site can be found at http://www.arrl.org/field-day-locator.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">The program consisted of the video &quot;A Kansas 
       Nightmare&quot; about the April 1991 tornado that hit Wichita, 
       Kansas, after which Bill (KB0RPD) presented an interesting one-hour 
       Storm Spotter Training program.</FONT></P>
