         Manager for the club .WA0KAQ has acted as Net Manager for the last 
         two years, and needs to step down from that position. NCS stations 
         are assigned for the next five weeks. Neal will be responsible for 
         setting up a schedule of NCS stations, overseeing net operations, and 
         for letting Bill know who is scheduled for NCS and about any new 
         stations who check in so they can be added to the net scripts and the 
         website. Also, if someone who is scheduled for NCS and can not do it, 
         the Net Manager either needs to have someone else do it or call the 
         net himself. </FONT></P>
