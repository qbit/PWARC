       decided he wasn't setting a good example for the club since he hadn't 
       been on the air much in the last three months, so he spent more time 
       on the radio the last few weeks.</FONT></P>

         Republic calling CQ on 15 meters. He didn't need the country but went 
         back to him. Immediately after he worked him, Dwight, WB0HBJ, worked 
         him. Both received the same signal report. Bill was using a 40 meter

        the task. A Nominating Committee consisting of Neal, KD0MBL, Jane, 
        KA0USA, and Lori, AH6OS, will select a slate of candidates for office 
        for 2011. The Committee will present its list of candidates at the

       Midway Atoll. Lori, her ham husband, and three other hams went there 
       in December 2001 and January 2002. She reported that since the island 
       is a bird sanctuary by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife, their flights on 
       and off the island had to be made at night. She showed photos taken 
       on Midway, including many WWII historical sites and wildlife 
       including Fairy Terns, Gooney Birds, Frigate Birds and more. The 
       island was beautiful, but the radio room was totally enclosed with 
       concrete and felt claustrophobic since it had no windows. She enjoyed 
       operating the radio, but said she enjoyed touring the island more.</FONT></P>
