        <FONT SIZE="4">Bill, WA0KAQ, stated he hadn't been on the air as much 
        during the last month. He had participated in Field Day and acted as 
        NCS for the team's the 5K Run/Walk comms on July 4. He worked Armenia 
        on SSB for a new country, and aircraft carrier USS Midway in San 
        Diego on PSK31. He received QSL cards from Australia and New Zealand 
        for PSK31 contacts; Sao Tome &amp; Principe, West Africa for CW; and 
        from a Mercy Ship that was docked in Sierra Leone on CW. Some of his 
        radio time this month was spent installing FLdigi software on 
        KA0USA's laptop, and configuring DM780 from the Ham Radio Deluxe 
        Software package on his laptop. For the last few days he has also 
        been experimenting with the RMS Express software, that can be used to 
        send e-mail messages computer to computer, radio to computer, or 
        radio to radio using the WINMOR mode. He has been exchanging e-mail 
        with Leon, N0VWX, in Coaldale, through RMS Express. He has started to 
        work on an old Alliance HD-73 rotor to get it ready for the mini-beam 
        project he hopes to put up in the fall.</FONT></P>

          <LI><FONT SIZE="4">Having an experienced CW contester in our group 
          certainly bolstered our score again this year. Dan made 129 contacts

          Traffic going toward McCulloch Blvd. only saw the back side. It was 
          also too far away from the site. Use the stand that was built for it 
          and place it where it will do the most good.</FONT><BR>

         <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
          <FONT SIZE="4">A complete station (radio, laptop, etc.) needs to be 
          on stand-by at the site in case of failure of any of the stations. 
          The failure of a laptop (unable to take a charge or run on battery 
          power) and something going wrong with either the radio or keyer 
          brought down our CW station. Fortunately, I had my Icom 706 and 
          laptop in the car and we were able to get the station up and running. 
          Unfortunately, however, I wasn't there when the laptop died and 
          manual logging became necessary for some time, which was an inconvenience.</FONT><BR>
          <LI><FONT SIZE="4">Better spacing of our antennas may have helped 
          reduce some interference between rigs.</FONT><BR>
          <LI><FONT SIZE="4">I think the choice of using a vertical and a 
          dipole was a good idea, however some thought might be given to have a 
          way to switch the antennas between rigs to see what is working best 
          from time to time. This might have been advantageous.</FONT><BR>
          <LI><FONT SIZE="4">A better system of measuring the battery voltage 
          available needs to be found. I monitored the CW station Sunday 
          morning for a little while, and the battery voltage was so low that 
          the signal was terribly raspy and very wide.</FONT><BR>
          <LI><FONT SIZE="4">Laptop screens were basically unreadable during 
          daylight hours. Some way of darkening the areas around the computers 
          need to be found.</FONT><BR>
          <LI><FONT SIZE="4">There was no way to keep three stations on the air 
          all night, as there weren't enough operators who stayed over. If you 
          are going to have three stations, you need six operators during the 
          night to trade off sleeping and operating.</FONT><BR>
          <LI><FONT SIZE="4">You may be familiar with your equipment, but when 
          you drop it off with no operating instructions or information on how 
          to hook up cables to various pieces of gear, it doesn't help the 
          effort. At least make a cheat sheet and a diagram of cable hookups to 
          send with it and MARK YOUR CABLES!!</FONT><BR>
          <LI><FONT SIZE="4">Let's try to standardize the PSK31 program, or at 
          least the macros, so when someone sits down to operate your rig he 
          will know how to use it. Everyone bringing a rig for PSK31 needs to 
          add a &quot;chat&quot; macro whereby the operator can ask for 
          information he did not receive or answer other stations' questions.</FONT><BR>
          <LI><FONT SIZE="4">A sheet of WRITTEN information about what is 
          happening at FIELD DAY (not HAMFEST) should be available to give to 
          media personnel. If we want them to be there to tell our story, they 
          need to receive the correct information.</FONT><BR>
          <LI><FONT SIZE="4">Six meters was open, yet no one took advantage of 
          it either with one of the three stations or an additional station 
          that would not have counted against our entry Class.</FONT><BR>
          <LI><FONT SIZE="4">Last year we only operated one station at night 
          because an 80 meter antenna that was promised didn't show up. This 
          year we had an 80 meter antenna available, and not one contact was 
          made on that band.</FONT><BR>
          <LI><FONT SIZE="4">We need more signs, balloons&ldots;. something to 
          attract the public's attention.</FONT><BR>
          <LI><FONT SIZE="4">There should be a co-chairman joined at the hip to 
          the Field Day chairman in case the chairman can't be there, as 
          happened this year.</FONT><BR>
          <LI><FONT SIZE="4">We need to assign times for operators to work the 
          station so that we have help at night.</FONT><BR>
