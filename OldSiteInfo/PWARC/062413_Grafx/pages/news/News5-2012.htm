       <FONT SIZE="4">Pueblo West Amateur Radio Club is an ARRL Affiliated 
       Club, and we encourage our members to join the ARRL. The dues amount 
       to a little more than $3.00 a month for an individual membership, and 
       the information received from the monthly QST magazine you receive is 
       well worth the price.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">To retain our affiliation, the club needs to maintain 
       a 51% ARRL membership. For that, the club may retain $2 of the annual 
       ARRL dues, and $15 for each new membership. If you are joining ARRL 
       for the first time or are renewing, please do it through the club so 
       that some of your payment will go to our club's treasury. See WA0KAQ 
       for application forms, and return them to him when you have filled 
       them out.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Following the meeting, the club has 38 members, 37 of 
       whom are licensed. Of those 11 hold Technician licenses, 7 have 
       General licenses, 3 hold Advanced licenses, and 16 have Amateur Extra 
       licenses. Of the 37 voting members, 22 belong to ARRL. (59%).</FONT></P>
