       feed through for his antennas. He is pleased with it, and he found he 
       could also raise his &quot;slinky&quot; dipole an additional five 
       feet. He says the antenna seems to work better now on 40 and 20 meters.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Dan, NG0T, notes work has kept him off the air 
       recently, however he worked 8 hours of cw at Field Day and has also 
       been checking into the club's VHF net where shares NCS duties.</FONT></P>

       says she has received QSL cards from Turks &amp; Caicos Island, the 
       Battleship Missouri, the Galapagos Islands, and a special events card 
       commemorating the 150th Anniversary of the Pony Express. Last

       prospects as soon as they are written and are posted on our website, 
       beginning with the January 2010 meeting. A copy of the minutes of the 
       previous month's meeting is always available at the sign-in table for

      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

       for Field Day that can be used at future events.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">The big news is that Walmart has again changed its 
       policy pertaining to vendors. As of last week, no organization that 
       is not a non-profit organization is being allowed to sell anything in 
       front of Walmart. This new ruling will also prohibit our club from 
       holding future Bake Sales there unless we obtain non-profit status.</FONT></P>

      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Classes are being held temporarily in the Pueblo West 
       Library from 7-9:00 p.m. each Thursday. Paul reported that one night 
       they used a study room, and another night they used the King Room. 
       Once students start back to school, however, it may be more difficult 
       to obtain a study room. The library does not accept weekly 
       reservations for rooms, only monthly.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">A Volunteer Examiner session will be held at Pueblo 
       West Library from Noon until 2 p.m. Saturday, August 21. The amateur 
       radio exams will precede our regular meeting at 2 p.m. At least two 
       ham class students will be taking exams. Kirk, KD0LDH, will be 
       testing for his General license, and David Yeater will be going for 
       his Technician and possibly General license.</FONT></P>

         making telephone calls and sending e-mails to members who were not in

        <!-- $MVD$:spaceretainer() -->&nbsp;
        <UL>
         <FONT SIZE="4">WA0KAQ repeated that Walmart is now taking the 
         position that any organization that is not non-profit is not allowed 
         to sell anything in front of Walmart, effective immediately. This new 
         ruling will prohibit our club from holding future Bake Sales at 
         Walmart unless the organization has non-profit status.</FONT></P>
        <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
         <FONT SIZE="4">The club discussed becoming a 501(c)(3) non-profit 
         corporation this year, and was told the filing fee would be about 
         $400. The club has the funds necessary, and if it is going to hold 
         future fundraisers at Walmart, it will need the non-profit status.</FONT></P>
        <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
         <FONT SIZE="4">The past two Bake Sales have averaged $250 each in 
         income for our treasury, and Jane would like to have another one in 
         September if the members agree to that. Whether or not the non-profit 
         corporation can be set up by that time, and if the fundraiser can be 
         scheduled early enough, is yet unknown.</FONT></P>
        <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
         <FONT SIZE="4">In addition, annual membership dues will start 
         becoming due at the August meeting. The anticipated revenue from 
         those expected to renew their membership by the end of the year is a 
         minimum of $180, and it could be more.</FONT></P>
        <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
         <FONT SIZE="4">Membership renewal fees, along with what we would have 
         left in the treasury after the $400 fee was paid, would leave us with 
         an estimated $500 in the treasury at the end of the year. If we can 
         have the fundraiser, it will be more. However, we may be too far into 
         the winter season to hold a Bake Sale when the incorporation is finished.</FONT></P>
        <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
         <FONT SIZE="4">KB0RPD made a motion to have NG0T move forward with 
         the non-profit corporation application. The motion was seconded by 
         KB0JIT. The club members voted unanimously to file the necessary 
         paperwork for the non-profit incorporation. NG0T noted it may take 
         some time to get the paperwork together and get the results back. He 
         said a minimum of 90 days would probably be a reasonable time period 
         for the process.</FONT></P>

         did their part and helped in any way they could. He also reminded 
         members that several months ago he told them that if they were 
         willing to work at it, their results could surprise some people in 
         the competition as well. He noted that they even surprised him. 
         Although the results won't be known until November, the club did very 
         well for its first event. If this year's score was plugged into last 
         year's results the club would have rated number 7 nationally in a 
         class with 25 stations.</FONT></P>

         event will be available to the committee.</FONT></P>

        <FONT SIZE="4">NE0DA noted the club's HF net on 10 meters is only 
        having sporadic check-ins, and that there is nothing new to report on 
        it after the VHF net has been held. In addition, many stations have 
        to be relayed to net control due to propagation conditions. With the 
        VHF net being more effective for our local communications, the 
        decision was made to discontinue the HF net.</FONT></P>
