         presentation on Friday, February 18. There is no school on Friday;

         <FONT SIZE="4">The presentation will be held in the school's library

         and Gifted students, however all Skyview Middle School students will

         <FONT SIZE="4">Bill stated Mr. Seip may be interested in obtaining a 
         ham license, and it is hoped this presentation will lead to a club 
         being formed in the future. Ed, NI5R, suggested the club purchase a 
         Gordon West License Manual and loan it to Mr. Seip. If the 
         influential teacher would get his ham license, it is felt several 
         students may follow his example. Ed made a motion to purchase the 
         license manual, and David, KY6YYY, seconded the motion. The motion 
         was approved on a unanimous voice vote. Ed will purchase the book and 
         be reimbursed by the club.</FONT></P>

         <FONT SIZE="4">The Roundup has specific rules pertaining to 
         multi-transmitter operation. PWARC would set up stations for Phone, 
         CW and PSK-31, however only one transmitter can be used at a time. 
         The ideal situation would be to have one student talking and one 
         student logging while using the phone transceiver. The operators will 
         oversee the transmissions and will use the club's NA0PW call sign.</FONT></P>

         members for only 5 hours of use, including the parade which takes 
         most of the potential customers out of the booth area. Food booths

         <FONT SIZE="4">Neal, KD0MBL, revived the idea of having a club logo a 
         few weeks ago, so this idea was brought to the members. David, 
         KY6YYY, had been thinking along the same line and has started to 
         design a logo for the club to consider. The logo would be something 
         that could be used on T-Shirts, hats, or made into patches. More 
         information is forthcoming.</FONT></P>

         <FONT SIZE="4">WA0KAQ was directed at the December meeting to contact 
         United Way of Pueblo and ask if they would like back-up 
         communications for their event. Bill talked to race coordinator 
         Bianca Hicks, who was very excited about having our club participate. 
         Last year the number of participants was 240 runners and 61 who 
         walked the course. This was double the number who participated the 
         year before, and Hicks anticipates this year's event may be even 
         larger. As the race planning progresses, she and Bill will be in 
         contact to determine the club's role in the event.</FONT></P>

         <FONT SIZE="4">As a Non-Profit Organization, our club needs to use 
         some of its funds to help the community. WA0KAQ suggested the club 
         might consider making a small scholarship available in the future to 
         a Pueblo West High School graduate who intends to major in science in 
         college, or better yet to teach science after college graduation.</FONT></P>

         <FONT SIZE="4">The club made a donation of a CQ Magazine subscription 
         to the library last year in April for National Library Week. WA0KAQ 
         asked if the members had taken advantage of having the magazine 
         available, and if this should be done again this year, or whether 
         something else might be more suitable. A few members said they read 
         the magazine, some monthly. Billy, K5LKT, suggested buying an ARRL 
         Handbook in place of the subscription. No decision was made, and this 
         will item brought up at a future meeting.</FONT></P>
