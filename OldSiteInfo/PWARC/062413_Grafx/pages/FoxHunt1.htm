       <FONT SIZE="4">Besides the requirement of having a radio that can 
       receive signals from the Fox, the hunter will find a directional 
       antenna to be an essential part of his equipment. The &quot;Tape 
       Measure Antenna&quot; described below is both inexpensive and simple 
       to build. It is made from a 1&quot; metal tape measure and PVC pipe.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4"><B>Parts List:</B> (Drawings may be slightly different 
       than the antenna being built, but the dimensions are the same. 
       Drawing below shows 2 &quot;X&quot; connectors and a &quot;T&quot; 
       connector. By replacing the &quot;T&quot; connector with another 
       &quot;X&quot; connector, a handle can be put on front end to use when 
       nulling a strong signal. The 1/2&quot; pipe in the drawing has been 
       replaced by 3/4&quot; pipe for better stability. Hose clamps may be 
       used on the reflector and director elements if desired.)</FONT></P>

       <FONT SIZE="4">Care should be taken when working with sharp metal 
       edges. Use gloves to prevent cuts and safety glasses to protect your 
       eyes from flying debris. Care should also be used when cutting the 
       metal tape as burrs created by the cuts could inflict injury.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4"><B>STEP 1.</B> Take the 36&#148; PVC tube and cut one

       <FONT SIZE="4"><B>STEP 2.</B> Assemble PVC tube pieces and PVC

      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4"><B>STEP 3.</B> Remove the tape from the case. The 
       easiest way to accomplish this is to pull the tape completely out 
       until you see the metal return spring to which it is attached. Simply 
       rotate the tape till the tab of the spring can be slid through the 
       slot in the tape. The spring will recoil into the case and the tape 
       will be ready for trimming.</FONT></P>

       <FONT SIZE="4">Jane, KA0USA, is proud of the performance from the 
       tape measure antenna. She did most of the work herself, including 
       cutting the PVC pipe with a chop saw and tinning the driven elements. 
       The tape<IMG SRC="Jane with antenna.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="518" VSPACE="10" HSPACE="10" BORDER="1" LOOP="0"> 
       measure she used for the elements was purchased for $1.99 at Harbor 
       Freight. She used 6 muffler clamps to attach the elements, rather 
       than using screws to attach them to the PVC fittings. The ends of 
       each element were covered with electrical tape. None of the PVC 
       fittings are glued to the boom.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Jane's antenna shows good a front to back ratio and 
       side signal rejection. Signal readings from the Colorado Connection's 
       145.130 repeater showed an S9+20 db (the highest the meter will show 
       on our rig) with the antenna pointed at it, an S4 reading off the 
       back of the antenna, and S0 (just noise) off the side of the antenna.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">The original space between the driven elements was 
       1&quot;. We did tweak the SWR just a bit by decreasing the distance 
       between the driven elements by 3/16&quot;, but as built, Jane's 
       antenna was okay for use as a transmit antenna as well.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">The length of the driven element could be shortened 
       just a bit more, but it is quite usable as is. The SWR at 144 MHz was 
       slightly over 1.3:1 at 144 MHz, less than 1.2:1 at 145.5 Megs, and 
       less than 1.7:1 at 148 MHz. Any further tuning will be done by 
       trimming the ends of each of the driven elements 1/16&quot; at a 
       time. No adjustment was made to the 6&quot; hairpin match made from 
       uninsulated #14 solid copper wire.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">An 8' length of RG-58 was used to connect the antenna 
       to the radio.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Tests have shown that the antenna does not function 
       well in windy conditions, as the elements tend to flap in the breeze. 
       However, in calm conditions the antenna works well and is reputed to 
       have a gain of about 7 db. In combination with a suitable attenuator, 
       it makes a formidable T-Hunt antenna.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=CENTER>
       <FONT SIZE="5"><B><FONT COLOR="RED">Do not use the antenna to 
       transmit unless you carefully adjust the &#147;hairpin&#148; and 
       element length to give a low VSWR and an impedance very near 50 ohms.</FONT></B></FONT></P>
