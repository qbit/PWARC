       <FONT SIZE="4">While ham radio operators normally are always trying 
       to increase their ability to hear stations, those involved in Fox 
       Hunting (hidden transmitter hunting) find strong signals to be a 
       hindrance as they near their objective. Signal strength the meters on 
       their radios show the hunters (Hounds) that they are getting close to 
       the hidden transmitter (Fox), but as the Hounds get close to the 
       transmitter, the strong signals make the signal strength meters 
       (S-meter) on radios useless. The closer you get to the transmitter 
       you're seeking, the tougher it is to find! Some means of reducing the 
       amount of signal that the radio receives becomes necessary.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">An attenuator placed in the feedline between your 
       antenna and receiver will diminish (attenuate) the strength of the 
       received signal. The S-meter can then be used to observe signal 
       strength variations as you proceed closer to the hidden transmitter.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">There are basically two types of attenuators.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <U><B><FONT SIZE="5">Active Attenuators</FONT></B></U></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Active attenuators make use of active components and 
       thus require a source of power (e.g., a battery) in order to 
       function. The offset attenuator is an example of an active 
       attenuator. <IMG SRC="../pics/offset4.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="243" HEIGHT="252" VSPACE="10" HSPACE="10" BORDER="1"></FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Instead of directly attenuating the incoming signal, 
       an offset attenuator works by adjusting the strength of an offset 
       frequency signal. When using this type of attenuator, your receiver 
       needs to be tuned to the offset frequency (usually 2 or 4 MHz either 
       direction), instead of the frequency of the signal you are hunting. 
       Since your receiver is tuned to a different frequency from that of 
       the signal you're hunting means that your receiver will not be as 
       affected by a strong hunt-frequency signal entering through the 
       receiver's plastic case.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">The small offset attenuator at right is available 
       assembled and tested ($27.00) from K0OV. It is good for getting close 
       (within a foot) to perhaps a watt or two. If you will be hunting 
       higher power transmitters, then a shielded box might be necessary and 
       possibly a switched 20 dB attenuator to keep the module from getting 
       saturated with the unwanted signals. The offset is available in 
       either 2 MHz or 4 MHz, and both seem to work just fine. The 4 MHz 
       offset is probably preferable to reduce the possibility of in band 
       interference. Generally, the 2 MHz is used for receivers that cannot 
       tune out of band.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Plans for other simple active attenuators can be found 
       by searching the Internet.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">One disadvantage of offset attenuators is that they 
       require a battery to make them work, so you've got to remember to 
       turn them on... and off! Another drawback to most offset attenuator 
       designs is that their attenuation level is not calibrated; so you can 
       never be certain just how much attenuation you're using. Also, since 
       most designs use a potentiometer for adjusting attenuation level, it 
       is difficult to return precisely to a previous attenuation setting. 
       And because most offset attenuator designs include no filtering 
       between the antenna and the mixer, the attenuator is potentially a 
       very prodigious intermod producer. This can be a real problem when an 
       offset attenuator is used in an area with strong out-of-band signals, 
       such as neighborhoods near broadcast or paging towers.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Note: Avoid transmitting through an offset attenuator. 
       Doing so could possibly destroy the attenuator or harm your radio. If 
       it doesn't destroy the attenuator, it will almost certainly result in 
       strong out-of-band signals being generated by the mixer in the attenuator.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <B><U><FONT SIZE="5">Passive Attenuators</FONT></U></B></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Passive attenuators contain no active components, but 
       inherently impose an absorptive or reflective loss directly to any 
       signal passing through them. The resistor network attenuator (or resistor<IMG SRC="../pics/MFJ-762.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="450" HEIGHT="178" VSPACE="10" HSPACE="10" BORDER="1"> 
       step attenuator) is and example of a passive attenuators. Most 
       attenuators of this type are operated using a series of switches that 
       select a variety of resistor values. By configuring the switches 
       appropriately, any attenuation level between 1 dB and 80 dB can be 
       selected, in 1-dB steps.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">For much of the hunt, a resistor-network attenuator 
       will work quite well. Unlike most offset attenuators, 
       resistor-network attenuators provide accurate, and very repeatable, 
       attenuation settings. Also, most passive attenuators will not 
       generate intermod signals that might interfere with your hunting efforts.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Shown at the right is the MFJ-792 Step Attenuator that 
       provides up to 81 dB in signal attenuation. These units sell new for 
       about $90.00, but they can sometimes be found on Ebay or other 
       on-line Internet auctions for much less.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">For those wishing to build their own step attenuator,

       <FONT SIZE="4">Fortransmitter hunting, passive attenuators have 
       several drawbacks. The most serious drawback results from the 
       tendency of most receivers to pick up strong signals directly through 
       their plastic cases, pinning the S-meter, regardless how well the 
       attenuator reduces the signal arriving at the antenna jack. It is 
       possible to address this problem by installing additional shielding 
       (e.g., aluminum foil) to the case of your receiver, and using 
       double-shielded feedline between the receiver and your antenna.</FONT></P>

        of attenuation used is a great feature, but as an alternative, one 
       of more fixed value attenuators can be used if needed. If you have a 
       radio with an SMA or a BNC antenna connector, you might be able to 
       find a variety of fixed value attenuators on Ebay that will connect 
       directly to your radio.</FONT></P>

      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Ok, so what are your options if you want to go on a 
       Fox Hunt this weekend and have no attenuator? You might want to try 
       these techniques.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <B><FONT SIZE="4">Tune Off Frequency</FONT></B></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Try tuning your receiver 5 kHz or more above or below 
       the transmitter's frequency. This effectively uses the skirts of the 
       IF passband to attenuate the signal and keep you in the hunt. Since 
       you are no longer tuned atop the signal's carrier, you'll probably 
       notice that any modulation of the signal will cause the signal 
       strength to appear to jump around. So this is a less-than-ideal 
       substitute for a &quot;real&quot; attenuator.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <B><FONT SIZE="4">Rotate Your Antenna</FONT></B></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">You can attenuate the signal you're hunting by 
       orienting your antenna so that its angle of polarization is not 
       aligned with the signal's polarization. For instance: if you hold a 
       yagi antenna so that its elements are aligned vertically, the antenna 
       will be less efficient for hunting a signal that is horizontally 
       polarized. The yagi antenna will pick up the signal more weakly when 
       it is misaligned in that manner, which is just what you want.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <I><FONT SIZE="4"><B>Note:</B> the previous three suggestions will 
       help knock the signal strength down so that you can continue to use 
       your receiver and VHF beam antenna. The remaining suggestions will 
       require that you reconfigure your hunting equipment and hunting style.</FONT></I></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <B><FONT SIZE="4">Tune to a Harmonic</FONT></B></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">If you have a receiver capable of tuning to a multiple 
       of the transmitter's frequency, try listening to the second or third 
       harmonic. (That's two times, or three times the transmitter's 
       frequency.) If you can hear one of the harmonics, you're getting 
       close. Once you can hear a harmonic, you might switch over to an 
       antenna designed for the harmonic frequency. If you are using a tape 
       measure yagi, shorten the elements by tucking them inside the 
       &quot;X&quot; connectors.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <B><FONT SIZE="4">Body Fading</FONT></B></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Body fading (or body shielding) is a technique that 
       can be used when you're stuck without better hunting equipment. The 
       technique involves holding the receiver close to your abdomen, and 
       then rotating your body slowly while observing the signal strength 
       indicated by the receiver. First start by using a rubber duck 
       antenna. If the signal is still too strong, disconnect the antenna. 
       When you observe minimum signal strength, the direction to the 
       transmitter is most likely behind you. This technique works best when 
       you can ensure that the receiver is picking up only line-of-sight 
       signals from the transmitter. Most reflected signals will not be 
       strong enough for your receiver to pick them up without an antenna. 
       Which means you will be most successful with the body fade technique 
       when you are close enough to the transmitter that you can perform 
       body fade with no antenna connected to the receiver.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <B><FONT SIZE="4">Remove the Antenna</FONT></B></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Do you think you might be right on top of the 
       transmitter, but you're not sure? Try this test: disconnect the 
       antenna from your receiver. Do you still hear the signal? If yes, you 
       are getting close to the transmitter. If the signal is still full 
       scale with the antenna disconnected, you may be very close! But be 
       careful. Most handy talkies today have plastic cases, and may pick up 
       the signal without an antenna when you are still some distance from 
       the transmitter.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <B><FONT SIZE="4">Aluminum Foil</FONT></B></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Is the signal too strong even with no antenna attached 
       to the receiver? Try wrapping some aluminum foil around your 
       receiver. (CAREFUL: Place some electrical tape over any exposed metal 
       charging pads on your receiver or battery pack. You don't want to 
       short out the battery!) The aluminum foil should help shield the 
       receiver, and knock the signal strength down again (still no antenna 
       attached). Instead of wrapping your receiver with foil, you can put 
       foil around a cardboard box or tube, and then place the receiver 
       inside the foil-covered container. In either case you'll need to cut 
       a hole in the foil (and box) so that you can see the signal strength 
       indicator. Once you've done that, try the &quot;body fade&quot; 
       technique, this time with the foil shielding in place and no antenna attached.</FONT></P>
