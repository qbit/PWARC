       <FONT SIZE="4">Vice-President Andy Lloyd, ND0P, called the Pueblo 
       West Amateur Radio Club meeting to order at 2 p.m. Saturday, May 15. 
       Those in attendance were:</FONT></P>

       </UL>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Instructors KB0JIT and NI5R reported the club's ham 
       class currently has two hams studying for their General licenses. Two 
       students, including a new student this week, are studying for their 
       Technician licenses.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Treasurer Dan Broadbooks, NG0T, reported the club has 
       $385.60 in its treasury.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Ways and Means Chairperson Jane Ewing, KA0USA, 
       reminded the members of the upcoming bake sale at Walmart on Sunday, 
       May 23, from 9 a.m.-1 p.m.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">NG0T delved into the question as to whether the club 
       needs a Board of Directors. His interpretation of the rules is that 
       the club does need at least one director. NI5R proposed that KB0JIT 
       and ND0P become our club's Board of Directors, and KBJIT seconded the 
       motion. A unanimous vote followed. However, this will entail more 
       language be added to the club's Constitution. The change will be 
       voted on at the next meeting, and if a quorum is not present, members 
       will be polled by telephone or e-mail for their votes.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">WA0KAQ reported that he had contacted the ARRL Rocky 
       Mountain Division Director about the status of club's ARRL 
       Affiliation. N5ZGT reported he has signed the form and forwarded to 
       the ARRL Executive Committee, of which he is also a member. The 
       reported the Committee receives batches of applications for approval 
       periodically throughout the year, since that is most efficient for 
       staff and volunteers. Once received, final approval is made unless 
       there are any issues.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">NG0T reported a problem has arisen about the club's 
       incorporation and its tax status with the IRS. Dan explained, 
       &quot;When we filed for a Tax ID Number, we indicated that we 
       expected to be what is called a 501(c)(6), which is a non-profit, but 
       not a 501(c)(3). A 501(c)(3) is a type of organization that you can 
       make a donation to and write it off on your taxes. What I have since 
       learned is that the only way to become either one of these is to file 
       a form asking the IRS to bless your status - to officially say, 
       'We've looked at your paperwork and we're ok with you being a 
       501(c)(6) or a 501(c)(3).' A 501(c)(3) requires more paperwork than 
       the other. The bad news in all of this is that to get them to sign 
       off on your status requires an application fee with the application, 
       and either one of these is the same fee, and it is pretty hefty -- 
       $400 - which would wipe out our treasury. The good news is once 
       you've done that you can electronically file an annual report as long 
       as you don't take in more than $25,000 in a year. The report consists 
       of little more than saying, 'We didn't take in more than $25,000, 
       we're still here, here's our address and our contact point.'</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">&quot;The problem we have right now is that our tax ID 
       number is kind of in limbo. It's not officially associated with any 
       kind of organization. I know that sounds odd, but what that means is 
       that if I try to e-file something to that tax ID number that is non-profit,
        it will get kicked back. They are going to say, 'This isn't a 
       non-profit of either type in our database' - even though we said when 
       we filed for it 'This is what we expect we'll become.' So that's kind 
       of the problem we face.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">&quot;The immediate problem is that if we're 
       non-profit we need to file some type of form by Monday, May 17, for 
       last year, or an extension. We really can't file either one because 
       we aren't officially a non-profit. So, the best 'out' here that I can 
       see is to file as a &quot;c&quot; corporation, which is kind of the 
       default of what we would be as a corporation if we're not officially 
       a non-profit. I can accomplish that. Then we, as a club, need to 
       decide whether or not we're willing to go ahead with the $400 hit to 
       the treasury, and which of these two routes we wish to go - whether 
       we want to go to the extra trouble of becoming a 501(c)(3) or whether 
       we want to go with 501(c)(6), which is intended for social clubs, basically.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Dan noted that with a 501(c)(6) corporation, we could 
       take donations for anyone and they could take the donation off their 
       taxes. If a business was donating, they couldn't take it off as a 
       charitable donation, but they could take it off as a marketing or 
       good will type expenditure.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">&quot;The other problem in all of this,&quot; Dan 
       continued, &quot;is that if we were a non-profit right now and we 
       failed to file by Monday, there is a $20 a day penalty that kicks in 
       if we don't file in time. I apologize for that, because I didn't 
       become aware of that until a few days ago when I was looking at some 
       of this material. I had thought that we had the luxury of no real 
       penalties as long as there was no underlying tax. In fact, that is 
       not the case.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">&quot;If we were to go in and file for either one of 
       them now, and we came into existence officially on December 22, 2009, 
       if they favorably said you're either one of these, then the problem 
       is that you would have a late return that you are now filing where 
       they could assert these penalties and you might have an uphill battle 
       to get the penalty to go away.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">&quot;A 'c' corporation, which is the default 
       position, actually was supposed to have filed back on March 15. 
       However, if we take the approach that most of the money we took in 
       before December 22 is initial capital, not income, then we would 
       initially have a small loss for the year. The initial dues would be 
       counted as capital contributions, not as income. That would be 
       magical, because filing late on a 'c' corp where there is no net 
       income, there is no tax and no penalty. I can file a 'c' corp return 
       if that is agreeable to the club, to get us to a position that we 
       have filed something and the IRS shouldn't be bothering us for 
       non-filing grounds.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">&quot;I'm sure there are better things we could do 
       with our limited resources than to pour it into that, although that 
       would be a one-time-only expenditure.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">&quot;By going in as a 'c' corporation, we would 
       essentially have most of the rest of the year to decide what we 
       wanted to do. Even if we filed another 'c' corp again next year, it 
       would probably only be a nominal tax on our revenue over our 
       expenses. We could get rid of any tax by making sure we spend our 
       treasury down at the end of the year on something we wanted to spend 
       it on anyway.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">&quot;The question is whether everyone is agreeable to 
       my filing the 'c' corp return so that we give IRS something and get 
       them to not come asking why we haven't made so kind of a non-profit 
       filing - which we effectively can't do until we get them to say we 
       are some kind of non-profit.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">KB0RPD made a motion that the club let Dan proceed 
       with the filing for a 'c' corporation and we will look at the filing 
       of a 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(6) later in the year. All members voted in 
       the affirmative. The secretary will poll members by telephone until 
       the number of affirmative votes constituting a quorum is obtained or 
       until it is not possible to get the necessary number of positive votes.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">The Pueblo West Metropolitan Association Board will 
       issue a proclamation at its June meeting, proclaiming the last week 
       of June to be Amateur Radio Week in Pueblo West. NE0DA will accept 
       the proclamation. All members are welcome to attend.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">KB0RPD reported the National Weather Service has more 
       batteries ready for the club, but they have not yet been delivered. A 
       few more will be needed before Field Day. Following that event, 
       batteries will begin to be distributed to club members. The batteries 
       work well for back-up power for transceivers, handhelds, small 
       inverters and converters for computers, 12-volt lighting (especially 
       LEDs), small AM/FM radios, 12-volt fans, etc.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">KB0RPD requested the names and addresses of members 
       who attended last month's meeting at which he presented the Weather 
       Spotting program. Those who were in attendance are eligible to become 
       Weather Spotters for the National Weather Service.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">WA0KAQ reported he participated in a 2-hour Webinar in 
       April pertaining to Field Day. One of the topics discussed was how to 
       introduce ham radio to youth. A study showed that what interested 
       youth most about amateur radio were satellites, DX, Morse code and 
       Fox Hunting. One club went as far as to challenge a school class to 
       choose someone for a texting versus CW contest, as made popular some 
       time back on the Jay Leno Show. The prize was free pizza for the 
       class if the student won. A local pizza shop donated the pizza for 
       the publicity it received from the promotion. The class received the 
       pizza in spite of its loss, but the stunt put ham radio operators in 
       the classroom and gave them a chance to tell about their hobby as well.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">NI5R and KB0RPD will work together to contact local 
       schools to try to raise interest in our club working with the 
       students. Perhaps something like the contest described could be done 
       next fall.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">The club has no outside activities after Field Day. If 
       there is an interest in doing more this summer and in the fall, more 
       can be planned. Ideas are welcome. Here are a few things that were 
       suggested, though none were scheduled.</FONT></P>
      <UL>
       <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
        <FONT SIZE="4">1) Burger Burn - Covered dish picnic in the park with 
        family members invited. An HF station could be set up as well.</FONT><BR>
        <FONT SIZE="4">2) Antenna Party - Get together and build some HF antennas.</FONT><BR>
        <FONT SIZE="4">3) Special Event Station - Set up an HF station and 
        send out special QSL cards to mark an event. Several month's notice 
        would be required to get the event listed in QST.</FONT></P>
       </UL>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">The need for QSL cards was revisited. NI5R suggested 
       using Colorado postcards. KB0JIT volunteered to work on making a 
       card, too.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">There are 41 days left until Field Day, and by the 
       time the next meeting rolls around, there will only be 7 days. WA0KAQ 
       gave a progress report on what has been done.</FONT></P>
      <UL>
       <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
        <FONT SIZE="4">1) Invitations have been extended to Fire Chief Brian 
        Caserta and crew of Pueblo West Fire Department; Captain Jeff 
        Teschner and representatives of the Pueblo County Sheriff's 
        Substation; the Salvation Army; the American Red Cross; and the 
        Pueblo West Metropolitan District Board and District Manager.</FONT><BR>
        <!-- $MVD$:spaceretainer() -->&nbsp;</P>
       <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
        <FONT SIZE="4">2) NI5R has finished the frame for the club's banner.</FONT></P>
       <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
        <FONT SIZE="4">3) ND0P is working on the Field Day signs.</FONT></P>
       <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
        <FONT SIZE="4">4) NI5R is exploring simple projects to be built on 
        his project board for a Field Day educational activity.</FONT></P>
       <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
        <FONT SIZE="4">5) A code oscilator and key will be available as an 
        educational activity as well. KB0JIT will supply a code oscillator, 
        and visitors will have the opportunity to learn to spell their names 
        using Morse code. KB0RPD suggested setting up a laptop in conjunction 
        with the project so visitors could see their Morse code words appear 
        on the screen. WA0KAQ offered the solar power display he has built as 
        an option to power that computer.</FONT></P>
       <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
        <FONT SIZE="4">6) An ARRL Message Center will offer the opportunity 
        for visitors and members to send ARRL Radiograms to friends 
        throughout the country. Messages will be transferred to the Central 
        Colorado Traffic Net on Saturday evening.</FONT></P>
       <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
        <FONT SIZE="4">7) The band-pass filters for the competition radios 
        have been completed by WA0KAQ and KB0JIT.</FONT></P>
       <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
        <FONT SIZE="4">8) KA0USA has finished a tri-fold display poster to be 
        used as a center piece on the Information Table.</FONT></P>
       <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
        <FONT SIZE="4">9) Eight companies have sent catalogs and/or equipment 
        information for distributing to visitors. Three additional companies 
        have promised to send their newest catalogs the first part of June.</FONT></P>
       </UL>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">It was decided not to set up a 2-meter station for the 
       public to use. The original idea was to show how linked repeaters 
       provide coverage throughout much of Colorado.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Whether the club will be able to provide a porta-potty 
       is still unknown. One company wanted more than $200 to provide one. 
       ND0P will be checking another source.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Three more Annex N forms (Field Day scheduling forms) 
       were collected at the meeting. A schedule of operators, tour guides, 
       set-up personnel, etc., will be put together before the next meeting.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">ND0P presented a program about how he uses the free 
       Ham Radio Deluxe software to control his Yaesu FT-817 transceiver.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Due to a lack of time, the scheduled videos were not 
       shown. They will be rescheduled.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">With only a week left until Field Day when we have our 
       June meeting, the meeting will feature a dry run of Field Day set-up 
       and operations. Information will also be provided on using the N3FJP 
       Field Day logging software and filling out ARRL Radiograms.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">The meeting adjourned at 4 p.m.</FONT></P>
