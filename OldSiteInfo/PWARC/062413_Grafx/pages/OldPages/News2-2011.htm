       weather and working on antennas. He is in the process of installing a

       off the coast of Georgia, and a man using an old military rig and 
       running 15 watts from Tennessee. He also reported that he presented 
       Mr. Seip, Skyview Middle School teacher, with a Technician Class 
       License Manual. The club voted last month to buy the book to 
       encourage Mr. Seip and his students to study for their licenses. Ed

       <FONT SIZE="4">Ed, NI5R, noted that there was not a good turnout for 
       the Saturday morning classes held recently. He said the class 
       structure itself was better than the way classes had been held 
       before, and the plan is to hold another session of four 3-hour 
       classes in the future followed by a VE Session. Only two students 
       were tested at the Feb. 12 VE Session in Pueblo West.</FONT></P>

      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Bill, KA0RPD, reported everyone seemed to have a good 
       time, though youth attendance was not good and there were a few 
       equipment problems. They could not get PSK-31 to work, so all 
       contacts were made by voice on HF SSB and 2-meter FM simplex. Bill 
       called the experience a &quot;pre-Field Day drill.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Of the three boys who and one girl who talked on the 
       radios, two of the boys seemed very interested in becoming licensed, 
       and one has a receiver his father had used. Mr. Seip, the class 
       instructor, was pleased with the results. Tentative plans are to 
       expand on the presentation in October, as the ARRL School Club 
       Roundup will again be held the week of Oct. 17-21.</FONT></P>

      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">On Saturday it was decided that the float will be

        usually has a good turnout, he is looking for ideas to make it more

        useful, as some of the members have never used CW and have indicated 
        an interest in it. WA0KAQ said he would take the idea into consideration.</FONT></P>

        Several times we have had someone wanting to contact a station toward 
        the end of the net, and the station does not come back to a call. If 
        we had known the station was leaving, we could ask at the end of his 
        comments whether anyone had anything for him before he checked out. 
        This is just ordinary net courtesy, and we need to start doing this.&quot;</FONT></P>

        <FONT SIZE="4">&quot;Are You Training Followers or Leaders?&quot; was 
        the title of an article in a recent issue of the ARES E-Letter. The 
        article detailed how volunteers come out in force when a major event 
        takes place, however the vast majority have to be trained before they 
        can be of any use. Bill, WA0KAQ, said the same holds true in ham 
        clubs. If the leadership suddenly disappears, who will have the 
        knowledge and training to take over and do what is necessary?</FONT></P>
       <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
        <FONT SIZE="4">Bill acknowledged that more members than ever before 
        are taking on responsibilities for the club this year, and that is as 
        it should be. He praised those who participated in the School Roundup 
        as a fine example of volunteers taking on a task and following 
        through with it. Accomplishing tasks like this are great confidence builders.</FONT></P>

        <FONT SIZE="4">One of the club President's goals for 2011 is to train 
        more members to serve as Net Control Station for our net. Bill noted 
        that the net has grown to the point that it is not unusual to have 
        10-12 stations check in. Several members have supported the net by 
        handling the Net Control Station duties, and the experience should be 
        spread to more stations. He noted more members will be asked to 
        occasionally call the net. &quot;Once the first time jitters go away, 
        it's not that difficult,&quot; he said. We all know one another on 
        the net, so we are talking to friends. No one expects the net to run 
        flawlessly each week, and if there is a little goof up, so what? It's 
        a great way to learn to do things right the next time you call it.</FONT></P>
       <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
        <FONT SIZE="4">A few noted they couldn't hear all the stations. 
        &quot;That's what relays are for,&quot; Bill replied. &quot;If you 
        can't hear a station, someone else probably can and will tell you 
        what he said. That's just part of running a net.&quot;</FONT></P>
       <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
        <FONT SIZE="4">Former club President Jim McConnell agreed. &quot;It's 
        not difficult,&quot; he said. &quot;If you can read, you can call the net.&quot;</FONT></P>
