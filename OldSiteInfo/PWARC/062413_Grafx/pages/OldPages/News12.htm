         Ralph, KA0RER, met on December 9 with Todd Seip, 6th Grade Science 
         teacher at Skyview Middle School. The meeting centered on forming a 
         partnership between the Skyview school's science department and PWARC 
         with the intention of promoting science and math through Amateur 
         Radio. Mr. Seip was enthusiastic about the possibility of bringing 
         Amateur Radio into the middle school.</FONT></P>
        <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
         <FONT SIZE="4">Several options were discussed but the group decided 
         that as a first exposure, PWARC would bring a demonstration of 
         Amateur Radio to the middle school. The demonstration was tentatively 
         set for Thursday, January 27, at 10 AM. PWARC would set up 3 stations 
         running SSB, CW, and PSK31.</FONT></P>
        <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
         <FONT SIZE="4">The demonstration would take place in a 6th grade 
         science room where there is access through a window to the outside 
         for antennas. All 6th grade science classes, and the students from 
         the gifted/talented program would attend, and this could bring the 
         number of students to more than 200. The demonstration would last for 
         about 1 hour.</FONT></P>
        <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

         details may need to be changed. The subject of possibly making the 
         event a 2-hour demonstration was discussed, due to the large number 
         of students involved. KB0RPD will be working on more details with Mr. 
         Seip and will be asking for input and ideas from club members. A

        Way of Pueblo to see if they would like more communications for their 
        5K Run in Pueblo West on July 4. WA0KAQ was asked to make the

        stated that at their last meeting they asked him to find out our 
        club's feeling about having a joint Field Day. The consensus the club 
        came to was that Field Day is a single club exercise designed to test 
        that club's ability to respond to portable Field Operations, learn 
        new modes, and test equipment. It is also a time for members to get 
        together to bond as a club and have fun together. Therefore, the club 
        is not interested in holding a joint Field Day exercise. However, 
        should Pueblo Ham Club care to have a joint Special Event Station or 
        a joint Fox Hunt in the future, our members would probably be 
        agreeable to that.</FONT></P>
