       <FONT SIZE="4">Thanks for all the time and effort from NE0DA, ND0P, 
       KB0RPD, NG0T, WA0KAQ, KA0USA, KB0JIT, KA0RER, W0NHF, KC0QJK, KG6WSI, 
       NI5R and KD0LDH who<IMG SRC="5-23-10 bake sale.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="549" HEIGHT="458" VSPACE="8" HSPACE="8" BORDER="1" LOOP="0"> 
       participated in making our club's spring Bake Sale a great success! 
       Jane (KA0USA, left in photo), as the Ways and Means Committee, set a 
       goal to bring $300 into the club's treasury. Sales were $276.00, and 
       we received $17.20 in donations for a total of $293.20. In another 
       half an hour, we would probably have sold enough to top the goal, but 
       by then we had lost our shade from the building and the items on the 
       last table were getting quite sparse.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">When we packed up shortly after 1 p.m., Paul (KB0JIT) 
       had a few muffins left over that he gave to Jane. When Jane saw the 
       balance from the sale, she took some muffins and cookies to a 
       neighbor's home and sold them for an additional $7.00. (Jane's OM 
       Bill, WA0KAQ, thought she was going to take away a cherry pie Ty 
       (KG6WSI) brought and that Bill bought, but Jane finally relented and 
       let Bill keep it. HI HI ) Now how's that for determination? The 
       treasury will be receiving $300.20, and rest of the cookies that were 
       left over (almost 7 dozen) are in the freezer and will be taken to 
       Field Day as part of our free refreshments.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Thanks to Sharron Fortune (in black in photo above; 
       XYL of Bill, W0NHF) and 6-year-old Benji Lloyd (son of Andy, ND0P) 
       for their sales help. Benji was especially helpful in selling Whoopie Pies!</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Thanks also to Ed Force (NI5R) for making such a nice 
       frame for our club banner. It looked and worked great and will be a 
       nice asset for our Field Day event as well.</FONT></TD>

       <FONT SIZE="4">Despite a chilly wind, the bake sale started about 
       8:15 a.m. instead of the scheduled 9:00. As soon goodies started to 
       be placed on the tables, buyers began to appear. Sharon Fortune (XYL 
       of W0NHF) Jane (KE6DCE) and Marge Schoenhofen (a non-member friend of 
       Jane's) took over the sales duties. Shown behind the table (l-r) are 
       Sharon Fortune, Jane (KE6DCE), Bill (KC0QJK), Marge Schoenhofen, and 
       Andy (AB8HQ). Others members participating included Paul (KB0JIT), 
       Bill (WA0KAQ), Bill (W0NHF), Bill (KB0RPD), and Jim (NE0DA). Despite 
       a recent bout with double pneumonia and shingles, Ralph (KA0RER) also 
       stopped by for a few minutes to contribute to the cause.</FONT></TD>
