      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requires 
       every Amateur Radio operator to pass at least one of its three tests 
       to receive a license. The more licenses you pass, the more privileges 
       you receive on the radio. Becoming a ham is not difficult, however it 
       does require you to do some </FONT><U><FONT SIZE="4">work</FONT></U><FONT SIZE="4"> 
       to pass the examinations. If you are not willing to put in some time 
       studying for the required examination(s), you may want to take up a 
       different hobby.</FONT></TD>

      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">There are currently three license classes: Technician, 
       General and Amateur Extra. The higher grade the license you hold, the 
       more privileges you will enjoy.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Some hams never progress beyond the entry level 
       Technician license, and they are happy to just have the privileges 
       that license conveys. With this license they are limited to fewer 
       bands, and a majority of Technician license holders can be found 
       working on VHF and UHF frequencies.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">The General Class license is for those who want to 
       learn more about electronics and gain more High Frequency privileges. 
       This enables them the opportunity to talk farther and to use more 
       bands to communicate.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">The Amateur Extra license is the highest license class 
       available. A more thorough understanding of electronics is required 
       for this exam, but it also conveys all the privileges available to 
       the hobbyists.</FONT></TD>

      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">In years past, those who aspired to attain a ham radio 
       license had to learn the Morse code at prescribed speeds for each 
       license class. This requirement was eliminated a few years ago. Now, 
       you need only pass a multiple choice test to become licensed. The 
       current Question Pools for each of the exams are also available on 
       line at http://www.arrl.org/question-pools.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">If you want to purchase a basic license study guide 
       for any of the three classes of licenses, there are two we would 
       recommend. One is published by ARRL, and the other is authored by 
       Gorden West. These can easily be found by a search of the Internet. 
       Wherever you get it, just be sure to get then newest edition, as the 
       question pools change from time to time.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Recently, our club has been recommending the free 
       downloadable No-Nonsense license study guides by KB6NU. Our members 
       have commented they have found them to be very useful and easier to 
       use than the books listed above.</FONT></P>

       <FONT SIZE="4">Our club periodically offers free classes to help 
       those who are interested in joining our hobby. We have found, 
       however, that those who study at least <U>an additional hour a day at home</U> 
       have the best chance of passing their exam on the first try. Learning 
       what you can on your own, and then bringing your questions to the 
       classes, is the most effective way of learning.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">The passing grade on ham radio exams is 74%. We have 
       found that on-line practice tests can be a valuable part of the 
       learning process when studying for exams. As you progress toward your 
       goal and are studying the license manual, supplement your study by 
       taking at least <U>two on-line exams a day</U>. When you are 
       consistently receiving scores of 90% and above, you should be ready 
       for your exam. On-line practice tests are available at:</FONT></P>
