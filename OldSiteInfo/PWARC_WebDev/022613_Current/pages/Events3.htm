           <FONT SIZE="4">The sale brought the club its most successful venture 
           to date by bringing in $563. Not included in that total are a few 
           promised donations yet to be collected. This amount is almost double 
           that collected at the club's first Bake Sale in 2010.</FONT></P>

           PWARC scholarship fund for a Pueblo West High School graduating 
           senior in 2013. The balance of the funds will go in the club's 
           General Fund.</FONT><FONT SIZE="2"> ( Photo by KE0FI)</FONT></TD>

           <FONT SIZE="4">Pueblo West Amateur Radio Club held a Special Event 
           Station at Weisborg B-24 Aircraft Museum at Pueblo Airport on 
           Saturday, May 19 to honor our nation's Armed Forces. The museum also 
           held its Second Annual Fly-In that day. Jim, NE0DA, and Stan, KC0OYO, 
           (above right) were among the club's members who attended.</FONT></P>
          <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
           <FONT SIZE="4">The station consisted of a Yaesu FT-101E transceiver 
           from the early 1980's and an all-band dipole. Operators made their 
           contacts from beside a WW-II B-29 bomber.</FONT></P>
          <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
           <FONT SIZE="4">Band conditions were poor during the morning hours, 
           but in the afternoon 20 meters came alive. The operators found 
           themselves to be the focal point of a pile-up of stations wanting to 
           work them. According to the club's QSL Manager, K0LDS, a total of 82 
           contacts were made.</FONT></TD>
