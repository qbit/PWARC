       <FONT SIZE="4">Whenever severe storms are possible, the National 
       Weather Service (NWS) calls upon SKYWARN volunteer storm spotters to 
       track the most dangerous thunderstorms and tornadoes. Reports from 
       spotters provide the &quot;on the ground&quot; information</FONT>.<FONT SIZE="4"> 
       Forecasters at the National Weather Service combine information from 
       the spotters with that from radar, satellite, lightning detection 
       equipment and other tools. This provides timely and accurate 
       statements and warnings in an effort to save lives and property 
       during weather emergencies. Storm spotters may also be used to give 
       reports during winter snow storms, floods, seasonal hurricanes, and wildfires.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">SKYWARN has long been associated with amateur radio, 
       and many NWS offices maintain an amateur radio station manned by 
       amateur radio operators during times of severe weather. This allows 
       licensed amateur radio spotters to transmit their severe weather 
       reports directly to the NWS and receive up-to-date severe weather 
       updates even if regular communications are disrupted or overloaded by 
       the weather emergency.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">While some weather spotters are storm chasers, the 
       majority participate from their homes. It is preferred that home 
       weather <!-- $MVD$:picsz("299","400") --><IMG SRC="../pics/ws3610.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="209" HEIGHT="280" VSPACE="10" HSPACE="10" BORDER="1" LOOP="0">watchers
        have the means to measure temperature, wind and precipitation. Many 
       install home weather stations such as this one from La Crosse 
       Technology that I use. Software that comes with many of the home 
       weather stations allows the collected information to be displayed and 
       saved on a personal computer. Computerized weather stations are not 
       required. The NWS can also recommend preferred rain gauges that are 
       accurate and can be read manually. A ruler is also recommended for 
       measuring hail size and snow depth.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">One item recommended for all weather spotters is a 
       NOAA weather radio, or a scanner capable of receiving the NOAA 
       weather station broadcasts. The frequencies are:</FONT></P>

       <FONT SIZE="4">Another handy item for all homes is an &quot;all 
       hazards&quot; weather radio using S.A.M.E. (Specific Area Message 
       Encoding) technology. When the National Weather Service sends an 
       advisory, watch or warning, an alarm is set off </FONT><IMG SRC="../pics/mwr100
.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="280" HEIGHT="280" VSPACE="10" HSPACE="10" BORDER="1" LOOP="0"><FONT SIZE="4">in
        these radios to warn the owner of the event. In the model shown, 
       this can be a light, a siren, or a siren for 8 seconds followed by a 
       digital voice. A warning such as &quot;Tornado&quot; will be shown on 
       the screen. More warning information can be read by scrolling the 
       text on the unit's LED screen. Information on many other types of 
       hazardous conditions (flooding, landslides, hurricane statements, 
       chemical hazard warnings, boil water warnings, etc.) can also be 
       received. These units can be programmed to only allow the alarm to 
       sound in an individual county, or it can be set to allow alarms for 
       surrounding counties as well.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Weather radios of this type do not have to be 
       expensive. The Midland WR-100 at the right can be purchased new for 
       $25 to $35. I bought a used unit on eBay for $3.99, complete with the 
       wall wart for powering it, but that was probably an exception. Figure 
       on paying $10 to $15 for a used model like the one shown. After 
       downloading the missing manual from Midland for programming the unit 
       and replacing the three AA alkaline batteries that hold the memory in 
       case of a power failure, the unit worked great. It also features an 
       LED display with clock, alarm clock, snooze alarm, and one-button 
       access to the weather broadcast frequency of the seven given in the 
       chart above that is strongest in your area. Several manufacturers 
       make this type of radio, and they come in hand held models as well as 
       the desk top style shown. I've seen good hand held models for less 
       than $20. If you decide to buy a weather radio, be sure it uses 
       S.A.M.E. technology.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">The NWS is required to hold weekly and monthly tests 
       of their system, so this is an easy way to ensure your unit is 
       working and that the alarms are heard.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">It would be wrong to believe that only radio amateurs 
       are weather spotters. In fact, more than half of the SKYWARN 
       volunteers are not licensed radio operators. Weather spotters may 
       make their reports by telephone or the Internet if those services are 
       functioning. Anyone interested in pubic service who has some method 
       of communication with the NWS is encouraged to join SKYWARN. Call 
       your National Weather Service office for further information.</FONT></P>
