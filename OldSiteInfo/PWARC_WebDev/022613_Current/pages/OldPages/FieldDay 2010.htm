           Twelve licensed club members, one non-licensed member, and two

           <FONT SIZE="4">Two stations were set up, and both</FONT><IMG SRC="Dan Broadbooks FD 2010.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="442" VSPACE="10" HSPACE="10" BORDER="1" LOOP="0"><FONT SIZE="4"> 
           used solar panels to charge batteries to run the stations. NE0DA's 
           motor home used two 75-watt solar panels mounted on the roof. It also 
           featured a propane generator to run the air conditioner and keep the 
           unit cool.</FONT></P>
          <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
           <FONT SIZE="4">Station 1, owned by NE0DA, was used for the SSB and CW 
           modes. The rig was an IC-706 hooked to a vertical for 40-10 meters.</FONT></P>
          <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
           <FONT SIZE="4">This station made 119 CW and 26 SSB contacts. Dan 
           (NG0T), who enjoys and is very proficient in CW contesting, was 
           responsible for all of this station's CW contacts. He showed why CW 
           is a preferred mode for low power FD contesting, bringing in 1,190 
           points for his effort. The 26 SSB contacts supplied another 130

           <FONT SIZE="4">Solar powered Station 2, owned by WA0KAQ and KA0USA 
           set up in their trailer, used a generator donated by Pueblo West 
           Rental Center to run the air conditioner. The station was used 
           primarily more for teaching members how to operate PSK31 than as a 
           contest station. It consisted of a Yaesu FT-897D transceiver, and 
           MFJ-1279M Deluxe Sound Card Interface, an MFJ-945E mobile antenna 
           turner, and a homebrew jumpered Inverted &quot;V&quot; antenna cut 
           for 40, 20 and 10 meters. At least 9 </FONT><IMG SRC="David Ewing &amp; Ed FD 2010.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="424" VSPACE="10" HSPACE="10" BORDER="1" LOOP="0"><FONT SIZE="4">different

           <FONT SIZE="4">David Ewing (left), KC0RNI, son of WA0KAQ &amp; 
           KA0USA, upgraded his license to General last month in anticipation of 
           our Field Day. He came from Westminster to join us, and operated 
           PSK31 for the first time. In short order, he was soon instructing 
           others on how to use the mode and the FLdigi software. Ed (right), 
           NI5R, was one of the operators who will soon be using the mode from 
           their homes.</FONT></P>
          <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
           <FONT SIZE="4">Station 2 accounted for 78 PSK31 contacts by a variety 
           of members as they learned the new mode, and 14 CW contacts made in 
           the early morning hours by WA0KAQ, for a total of 920 points.</FONT></P>

           <FONT SIZE="4">Through no fault of our own, we were unable to check 
           into the Central Colorado Traffic Net on Saturday evening to send a 
           radiogram to the Colorado Section Communications Manager or to send 
           additional messages for bonus points. The net meets on the Colorado 
           Connection repeater system, and the transmit link from Colorado 
           Springs to Denver is unusable.</FONT></P>

           <FONT SIZE="4">Field Day also has an educational aspect as well as 
           the contesting side. KA0USA put together a nice information table 
           where visitors could learn about amateur radio and about our club. A 
           dozen companies supplied catalogs, flyers and other information about 
           their products, and information from the ARRL was also available. 
           Visitors also found free iced tea, ice water, lemonade and cookies to 
           take their minds off the hot weather on Saturday.</FONT></P>

           <FONT SIZE="4">Our local newspaper's lack of publication for 
           publicity for the event hurt us, but we did have some visitors. This 
           was due mainly to being located near S. McCulloch Blvd. and them 
           seeing our signs as they drove by. Of note, one ham who had lived 
           here for two years and didn't know there was a club in Pueblo West 
           stopped to get information. He noted he was ready to sell his 
           equipment on eBay, but now he may be joining our club.</FONT></P>

            no longer a requirement for a ham license, Morse code still holds

           <FONT SIZE="4">Due to sunless conditions on Saturday afternoon 
           following a brief period of lightning, the three 60-watt solar panels 
           did not produce enough current to run Station 2 through the entire 
           night. About 5:00 a.m. the battery voltage was dropping to about 11.3 
           volts on transmit, so it was decided to change the radio's power 
           source to a bank of four 18 Ah batteries. The batteries powered the 
           laptop computer and radio for the remaining 7 hours.</FONT></P>

           <FONT SIZE="4">Was the event a success? Did it meet the organizer's 
           expectations? Definitely! Everyone seems to have had a good 
           experience at Field Day, the first such event for the majority of the 
           members. The members worked together as a team in everything they 
           did, and whatever was needed they unselfishly supplied. They were 
           ready for new experiences, and no one seemed to leave disappointed.</FONT></P>
