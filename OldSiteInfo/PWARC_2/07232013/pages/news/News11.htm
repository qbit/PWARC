       After our non-profit corporation is finally accomplished, the plan is 
       to hold another bake sale in the spring as well. To help raise money 
       for future club activities, KA0USA presented a raffle for a Full 
       Service Oil Change Gift Certificate from Mountain View Automotive 
       Repair, 305 E. Industrial Blvd., Pueblo West. Bill, KB0RPD, was the 
       lucky winner. The raffle brought in $26.00 for the treasury. Thanks

       West Parks and Recreation Department in October to determine whether 
       the club would be able to hold an 8-week class through that entity, 
       and what the cost would be. WA0KAQ reported KB0JIT told him in 
       mid-October that he had gone to the Parks and Recreation office but 
       was unable to meet with the director. It is unknown whether a later 
       meeting occurred. The club was told earlier that the deadline for

       session will be held, however it will probably be after the first of 
       next year. Classes will be closed until after Jan. 1, 2011, due to 
       the holidays and to give the instructors a break.</FONT></P>

        placing even higher was that only one station ran through the whole 
        night due to the lack of a 75-meter antenna. He suggested that the 
        club have an antenna party in the spring and build a 75-meter dipole

         attenuators Paul had built based on a no longer available step

         passed around so members could view its construction. Bill also 
         showed a commercially-built attenuator made by MFJ Enterprises.</FONT></P>
