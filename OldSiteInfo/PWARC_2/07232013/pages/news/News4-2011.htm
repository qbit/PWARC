         asked the members whether they wanted to continue using the repeater 
         or revert to their simplex only net. Several members voiced their 
         opinions that the repeater access was good for the net, and they 
         enjoyed hearing stations check in from Canon City and the surrounding 
         area. The club appreciates the Royal Gorge Ham Club letting us use 
         their repeater, and the consensus was that we should continue to use 
         it. The simplex net will also continue following the repeater net, as 
         it encourages members to improve on their antennas and keep them in 
         good condition. Members are encouraged to check in to BOTH nets if 
         they have the necessary equipment.</FONT></P>
