       <FONT SIZE="4">Kirk Kelly, currently studying for his Technician 
       license in the club's classes, became the club's newest member. Kirk 
       will be testing for his Technician license on April 10.</FONT></P>

       <FONT SIZE="4">KA0USA has scheduled the club's spring Bake Sale for 
       Sunday, May 23, from 9:00 a.m.-1 p.m. at the Pueblo West Walmart. She 
       noted that the manager had the Saturday dates closed for all 
       activities, so she elected to take a Sunday.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">NE0DA stated the paper license for NA0PW has been received.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">NI5R has built a frame for the club's banner. It will 
       get its first use at the Bake Sale in May, followed by Field Day in June.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">The club has been searching for a way to entice 
       visitors to the Field Day site. This year we will be erecting signs 
       advertising free cookies and drinks. AB8HQ volunteered to make the 
       signs. Club members are being asked to bring cookies and pop to the event.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">The Committee On Architecture gave the club two forms 
       to fill out and hand in by May 18, but they would like to have them 
       as soon as possible. WA0KAQ drew up a site plan and information 
       detailing signs and antennas, and it was presented to KB0RPD to turn 
       in with the application forms.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">All the parts have arrived for the band pass filters. 
       KB0JIT has wound the toroids and WA0KAQ has the coax connectors 
       installed on the boxes, so it is just a matter of them getting 
       together and soldering the components and testing the filters.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">KD0RPD reported he is awaiting word about the possible 
       free use of a Porta Potty for Field Day.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">The Field Day Handbook that WA0KAQ has been assembling 
       will soon be sent by e-mail in Word format. Some appendixes will also 
       be sent; others will be sent later as information can be added to 
       them. If you can not open Word programs, let WA0KAQ know and other 
       arrangements will be made.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">WA0KAQ will have a Field Day sign-up sheet at the next 
       meeting, and it will also be sent out via e-mail. This sheet will be 
       used to start scheduling operators and modes for Field Day 
       operations. We will try to accommodate the wishes of as many of our 
       members as possible.</FONT></P>

      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">The club approved the idea of applying to ARRL to 
       become an ARRL Affiliated Club. The club has the necessary 51% ARRL 
       membership needed. The main benefit at this time would be that if 
       members renew their ARRL membership through our club, the club would 
       retain $2 per renewal. For NEW memberships, the club would retain $15 
       per new membership. There would be no fee retention for adding family 
       members, as the fee for this is only $8. WA0KAQ will prepare the 
       application forms in triplicate to send to the ARRL. The application 
       must be approved by ARRL Executive Committee, the Rocky Mountain 
       Division Director and the Colorado Section Communications Manager. 
       There is no cost to the club. Annual updates are required, and a 
       minimum 51% of the voting membership must be ARRL Members to maintain 
       the affiliation.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">April is National Library Month. In appreciation for 
       all the Pueblo West Library has done for the club, the members voted 
       to buy a 1-year subscription to CQ Magazine for the library. WA0KAQ 
       will make the necessary arrangements. The cost to the club will be $36.95.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">The club approved a request from WA0KAQ to fax a 
       letter to Committee Chairman Henry Waxman (D-CA-30) and Ranking 
       Member Joe Barton (R-TX-6), urging them to send Senate Bill S-1755, a 
       bipartisan bill, to the House floor for adoption. S 1755 points out 
       that &quot;[t]here is a strong Federal interest in the effective 
       performance of Amateur Radio Service stations, and that performance 
       must be given -- (A) support at all levels of government; and (B) 
       protection against unreasonable regulation and impediments to the 
       provision of the valuable communications provided by such stations.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">If enacted into law, S 1755 would instruct the 
       Secretary of Homeland Security to undertake a study -- and report its 
       findings to Congress within 180 days -- on the uses and capabilities 
       of Amateur Radio communications in emergencies and disaster relief.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">This month's program was billed as a demonstration on 
       PSK31 software and a live demonstration by KB0JIT and WA0KAQ. 
       However, WA0KAQ, was unable to attend due to back problems. KB0JIT 
       made the adjustment and presented an interesting program on Digipan 
       and PSK31. This is a popular mode that several of our members are 
       either trying or intend to try shortly.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
       <FONT SIZE="4">Next month's program will feature KB0RPD talking about 
       the NWS SKYWARN program.</FONT></P>
