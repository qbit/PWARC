        be tuned and they are strip line technology and that is hard to tune.</FONT></P>

        Amanda (K1DDN) said Jeff declined any help. Discussion was held on 
        the Canon City club tower being in trouble and they could use help 
        with cables and tower work. The info available was that they have 
        tower sections to use so it is possible they might need help with 
        making new cables. WA0NLK is the person to talk to about helping them.</FONT></P>

       <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
        <FONT SIZE="4">Discussion was held about the new repeater being 
        linked for the simplex net so many other people can check in. The 
        purpose of the simplex net is to test the ability of everyone to be 
        able to communicate in case of an emergency. Simplex nets also help 
        everyone to practice the use of relays in communicating. Simplex is 
        simplex. The point was brought up that linking the repeaters can be a 
        problem with delays and people not realizing the problems caused by 
        linking. Some frustration has been caused by the problems with linking.</FONT></P>
